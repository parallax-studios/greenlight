# GREENLIGHT — Game Pitch Document

**Game Dev Tycoon meets Crusader Kings meets The Movies meets Reigns**

*You're a game publisher executive in the mid-2000s. AI studios pitch you games. You decide who gets funded, who gets cancelled, and who gets a sequel. Every greenlight is a bet — on talent, on trends, on yourself.*

---

## THE HOOK

*[HYPE speaks]*

### Elevator Pitch

**You don't make games — you decide which games get made, and every greenlight shapes an industry you can't fully control.**

### Scroll-Stop Line

> "I greenlit a pirate MMO in 2006 because the focus group loved it. The studio went $40 million over budget, the lead designer had a nervous breakdown on a podcast, and it scored a 58 on Metacritic. It was the best decision I ever made — because it funded the sequel that defined a generation."

### The "Oh, That's Cool" Moment

Picture this: You're in a greenlight meeting. Three studios are pitching. The first is a slick PowerPoint from a sequel factory — guaranteed 80 Metacritic, $200M revenue, zero surprises. The second is a shaky webcam pitch from a three-person indie team with an idea so weird you can't stop thinking about it. The third is a legendary auteur studio that burned through their last publisher's money and got fired — they're begging for a second chance with a game that sounds either genius or delusional.

You fund the auteur. Six months later, the milestone review lands on your desk. They've built a revolutionary physics engine but forgot to make a main menu. Morale is high but the budget is bleeding. E3 is in four months. Do you intervene? Do you trust the vision? Do you demand they cut the procedural weather system and ship the damn game?

That decision screen — three studios, three gambles, your signature on the check — is the GIF. The consequences that ripple across years of in-game time are the hook that keeps people playing until 3 AM.

## THE CORE

*[REED speaks]*

### Core Loop

**The 30-second loop**: Read a pitch. Evaluate the studio, the concept, the market conditions, and your current portfolio needs. Greenlight or pass. Every pitch is a decision with incomplete information — you're weighing creative potential against commercial viability against your publisher's quarterly targets. The feel is a poker hand: you're reading tells, calculating odds, and occasionally going all-in on a gut feeling.

**The 5-minute loop**: Manage your active projects. Each funded game progresses through development phases — pre-production, production, alpha, beta, gold. At each milestone, you receive a review package: a build snippet, a morale report, a budget status, and a risk assessment. You choose interventions (or choose restraint). Between milestones, industry events fire — a competitor announces a similar game, a new console is revealed, a cultural trend shifts the market. Adapt or get blindsided.

**The session loop (45-90 minutes)**: Navigate a fiscal year. Balance your portfolio across genres, platforms, and risk profiles. Attend E3 (choose which games to showcase and how much floor space they get). Survive quarterly earnings calls where the board evaluates your performance. Manage studio relationships — studios remember how you treated them, and word spreads. End the year with a Metacritic roundup, sales figures, and a reputation shift that opens (or closes) doors for next year's pitches.

### Core Mechanics

1. **THE GREENLIGHT TABLE** — The central decision mechanic. Every quarter, 3-5 pitches land on your desk. Each pitch is a dossier: studio profile, concept summary, projected budget, estimated timeline, risk factors, and a "gut feel" indicator that reflects your executive's intuition (which improves with experience but is never fully reliable). You can greenlight, pass, or counter-offer (fund at reduced budget, demand changes, attach conditions). Counter-offers affect studio morale and the project's trajectory. You never have enough funding slots for every good pitch. Saying no to a great game is as defining as saying yes.

2. **THE INTERVENTION SYSTEM** — Once a game is in development, you can intervene at milestone reviews. Interventions are specific, named actions with concrete tradeoffs. **"Force Multiplayer"** adds 6 months and $8M but opens a revenue stream and risks fragmenting the studio's vision. **"Demand a Movie Tie-In"** locks the release window to a film date and adds marketing synergy but strips creative autonomy. **"Cut the Open World"** saves budget and timeline but tanks studio morale and kills the feature the lead designer cares about most. **"Ship It Now"** forces the current build to gold regardless of polish — risky, but sometimes the market window is closing. **"Expand Scope"** is the most dangerous: it signals trust and excites the studio, but it's a blank check written in hope. Every intervention has a visible morale cost, a budget impact, and a hidden quality modifier you won't see until reviews hit.

3. **THE PORTFOLIO MATRIX** — Your publisher has a portfolio identity expressed across three axes: **Prestige** (critical acclaim, awards, developer reputation), **Profit** (revenue, market share, shareholder confidence), and **Populism** (mainstream appeal, install base, brand recognition). Every game you ship moves the needle on all three. A critically acclaimed indie darling boosts Prestige but barely moves Profit. A movie tie-in sequel pushes Populism and Profit but may crater Prestige. The board sets targets each year on all three axes. Consistently ignoring one axis triggers consequences — a Prestige crash means top studios stop pitching to you; a Profit crash means budget cuts; a Populism crash means losing shelf space at retail.

4. **THE STUDIO RELATIONSHIP WEB** — Studios are not interchangeable content factories. Each studio is a persistent AI entity with a personality archetype, a track record, a morale state, and an opinion of you. **The Auteur Collective** (studio archetype: visionary) makes brilliant, over-scoped games and resents any creative interference — but if you earn their trust through hands-off publishing, they'll pitch you their magnum opus. **The Sequel Machine** (studio archetype: reliable) prints money with iterative franchises but will never innovate unless you push them — and pushing risks breaking what works. **The Indie Spark** (studio archetype: volatile) needs funding and mentorship but fights corporate mandates — support them gently and they'll produce a sleeper hit; micromanage and they'll implode or leave for another publisher. **The Legacy Studio** (studio archetype: fading) made the hits of the '90s but hasn't adapted — they need either a reinvention or a graceful sunset. Studios talk to each other. Cancel a game cruelly and the industry notices. Champion a struggling team and your reputation among developers grows.

5. **THE ERA ENGINE** — The game simulates the mid-2000s game industry as a living, shifting ecosystem. Each in-game year introduces real historical forces as systemic events. **2004**: Online multiplayer becomes a checkbox expectation. **2005**: The Xbox 360 launches — do you pivot to next-gen early or ride the PS2's massive install base? **2006**: The Wii disrupts everything — casual gaming explodes and your board demands a response. **2007**: Digital distribution platforms emerge — do you invest in this unproven channel or protect your retail relationships? **2008**: DLC becomes viable — do you mandate it across your portfolio or let studios decide? **2009**: Mobile gaming begins its ascent. These aren't flavor text. They're systemic modifiers that change which pitches succeed, which platforms matter, and which strategies are viable. The player who greenlit a Wii-exclusive party game in 2006 looks like a genius; the one who bet everything on a PS3-exclusive open-world RPG in the same year is sweating through earnings calls.

### What Mastery Looks Like

A beginner greenights games they personally think sound cool and intervenes whenever a project looks shaky. They lurch from crisis to crisis, overfunding sequels and underfunding originals, reacting to the market instead of anticipating it.

An intermediate player reads the Era Engine. They see the Xbox 360 launch coming and start greenlighting next-gen projects 18 months early. They learn which studio archetypes respond to which interventions. They maintain a balanced portfolio and survive earnings calls without sweating.

An expert plays the publisher like an instrument. They cultivate studio relationships across years, knowing that the Auteur Collective they championed in 2004 will pitch them a generation-defining game in 2007 — but only if trust is high enough. They read the focus group reports against the era trends and spot the gap: nobody is making a co-op action RPG for the Wii in 2007, and the studio they've been nurturing is perfect for it. They greenlight it at full budget with zero interventions. It scores 92 on Metacritic and sells 4 million copies. That's not luck. That's three years of portfolio management converging on a single greenlight.

The depth is in the long game. What's the player's verb at hour 1? Evaluate a pitch. At hour 20? Orchestrate an ecosystem of studios, platforms, genres, and market forces across a decade of industry upheaval. The 30-second decision is the same — greenlight or pass — but the context surrounding it grows exponentially richer.

### Unique Mechanic: THE GREENLIGHT TABLE

No other management sim puts you on the *funding* side of game development with this level of studio personality simulation. Game Dev Tycoon lets you make games. The Movies lets you run a studio. Greenlight puts you in the chair where the real power sits — the person who decides which visions live and which die — and then forces you to live with the consequences for years. The closest analog is Reigns' binary decision-making, but where Reigns is abstract and immediate, Greenlight is specific and longitudinal. Your greenlights from Year 1 are still paying dividends (or debts) in Year 5.

## THE HEART

*[NOVA speaks]*

### Theme

**Beneath the spreadsheets and the greenlight meetings, this game is about the tension between commerce and art — and the quiet, accumulating weight of being the person who decides which dreams get to exist.**

Every mechanic tells a story here, and the story is this: creation requires permission. Someone has to write the check. Someone has to say "yes, this deserves to exist." That person is you. And the terrible beauty of that position is that every "yes" is also a "no" to something else. Your budget is finite. Your greenlight slots are limited. The auteur's passion project and the sequel factory's cash cow are competing for the same funding round. You cannot have both.

This is a game about patronage. About the Medicis and the Sistine Chapel. About the executive who greenlit Star Wars and the one who passed on E.T. the video game and wished they had. About the distance between the person who creates and the person who enables creation — and whether that distance is a canyon or a hair's width.

### The World

The world is a publisher's internal universe, circa 2005 — and it's rendered with the specificity of a period piece that loves its era even as it sees its flaws. Your office has a frosted glass door with your name on it. Your desk has a Newton's cradle, a stack of focus group binders, and a framed cover of your first hit game. The conference room has a long mahogany table, a projector that takes 30 seconds to warm up, and a whiteboard covered in genre acronyms and projected COGS.

The wound of this world is **the distance between the people who make games and the people who fund them**. Studios pitch through PowerPoints and vertical slices, but you never see the crunch. You never hear the arguments at 2 AM about whether to cut the feature that made the game special. You see milestone reports — clean, formatted, sanitized. The cracks show through in morale numbers, in passive-aggressive emails from lead designers, in the studio that stops returning your calls. The world is a corporate dashboard overlaid on human ambition, and the gap between the data and the truth is where the game's emotional tension lives.

The aesthetic: think Bloomberg Terminal meets a 2005 EA internal portal. Outlook-era email interfaces. PowerPoint decks with too many bullet points and clip art. Excel spreadsheets with color-coded cells. Metacritic prediction algorithms rendered as pie charts. Quarterly earnings projections in boardroom presentations. The information design is corporate and sterile — and beneath it, human lives are being shaped by your decisions. The contrast is the point.

### Player's Emotional Arc

**Early game (Years 1-2)**: Power fantasy. You're the executive. You have the money. Studios come to you. It feels good to greenlight a game, to watch a pitch become a project, to see your name on the quarterly report. The decisions feel consequence-free because the consequences haven't arrived yet.

**Mid-game (Years 3-5)**: Weight. Your greenlights from Year 1 are shipping. Some are hits. Some are disasters. A studio you believed in delivered a broken game and their lead designer sent you a personal email thanking you for the opportunity — and you feel something you didn't expect. A sequel you forced into production scored well and sold millions, but the studio that made it is burnt out and their best people are leaving. The portfolio is growing but so is the complexity of caring about it.

**Late game (Years 6-8)**: Legacy. You can see the shape of what you've built. A publisher defined by your taste, your risk tolerance, your compromises. Studios you nurtured are now industry leaders — or cautionary tales. The games you greenlit are being discussed in retrospectives. The games you cancelled are "the ones that got away" in developer interviews. You are no longer making decisions in isolation; you are tending a garden you planted years ago, and some of the seeds grew into things you never intended.

**Endgame**: The final earnings call. The board reviews your tenure. But the real ending is the montage — a timeline of every game you greenlit, every studio you championed or abandoned, every intervention you made or withheld. The player sees the full arc of their publishing career and feels the specific, unnameable emotion of seeing a decade of small decisions become a legacy. Not pride, exactly. Not regret. Something in between. The feeling of having mattered to things that mattered to other people.

What does the player FEEL here? They feel the weight of power exercised through bureaucracy. They feel the strange intimacy of caring about a spreadsheet because the spreadsheet represents someone's dream. They feel the loneliness of the decision-maker who never gets to be in the room where the game is actually being made.

### The Story Hook

**The game opens with a cancellation.**

You inherit the publisher's chair from your predecessor, and the first thing on your desk is a kill order. The previous executive greenlit a game that's 18 months over schedule and $25 million over budget. The studio is begging for six more months. The board wants it dead. Your first decision as publisher is whether to mercy-kill someone else's bet or double down on a vision you didn't choose.

This is not a tutorial. This is a thesis statement. Every decision you make for the rest of the game is a variation of this one: do you serve the spreadsheet or the dream? And the game's quiet, persistent argument is that the answer is never cleanly one or the other. The best publishers do both. The question is how much of yourself it costs.

## THE MARKET

*[HYPE speaks]*

### Target Audience

**Primary**: Players aged 25-40 who work in or adjacent to creative industries and know the feeling of pitching something they believe in to someone who controls the budget. They play management sims (Game Dev Tycoon, Two Point Hospital, Planet Coaster) but wish they were deeper and more emotionally resonant. They have opinions about the game industry. They've read Blood, Sweat, and Pixels. They follow Jason Schreier. They hang out on r/Games, r/gamedev, r/tycoon, and ResetEra.

**Secondary**: Strategy and simulation players aged 20-35 who love systemic depth — the Crusader Kings, Dwarf Fortress, Rimworld crowd. They'll discover the Studio Relationship Web and the Era Engine and spend 200 hours optimizing portfolio strategies across decades.

**Tertiary**: Game industry professionals and enthusiasts who'll play it as a dark comedy mirror of their own careers. This is the audience that turns Greenlight into a cult hit through word-of-mouth, memes, and "you won't believe what happened in my playthrough" stories on Twitter/X.

**The crossover nobody sees coming**: Fans of Reigns, Papers Please, and Lucas Pope's work — people who love decision-making games where the weight of choice is the entire point. Greenlight is Reigns with 100x the systemic depth.

### Comparable Games

1. **"If Game Dev Tycoon met Crusader Kings"** — The business sim surface of Game Dev Tycoon married to Crusader Kings' dynastic relationship management, where studio personalities, grudges, and loyalties create emergent stories across decades.

2. **"If Reigns met The Movies"** — The binary decision-making tension of Reigns applied to the creative industry simulation of Lionhead's The Movies, but with the consequence chains extending across years instead of seconds.

3. **"If Football Manager met Papers Please"** — The deep personnel and tactical management of FM, but every decision carries the moral weight of Papers Please — you're not just optimizing, you're choosing whose dream lives and whose dies.

4. **"If Dwarf Fortress met Hollywood"** — A simulation so systemically rich that every playthrough generates unique stories, but set in the most relatable creative industry on earth.

5. **"If Civilization met Game Dev Story"** — The "one more turn" escalation of Civ's tech tree and era progression, applied to navigating a decade of real game industry history with the charm of Kairosoft's management games.

### Unique Selling Proposition

There are games about MAKING games. There has never been a game about FUNDING games — about being the person in the room who says yes or no to someone else's creative vision and then living with the consequences for a decade. Greenlight doesn't compete with Game Dev Tycoon or The Movies. It sits in a space nobody has claimed: **the publisher simulation**. The USP is the power and the weight of the greenlight decision — and the mid-2000s game industry setting that gives every decision historical texture and nostalgia resonance.

What's the hook in 5 seconds? You watch a pitch. You fund it or kill it. You live with it for years.

What's the GIF? A studio's passionate pitch deck on one side of the screen. Your greenlight stamp coming down. A time-lapse of development milestones. A Metacritic score appearing. A studio morale bar crashing. A developer's thank-you email arriving in your inbox. Five seconds, one story, infinite replayability.

### Platform Fit

**PC (Steam)**: Primary and ideal. This is a mouse-driven management sim with dense information displays. The Steam audience for tycoon and management games is enormous, passionate, and hungry for novelty. Tags: Simulation, Management, Strategy, Choices Matter, Economy, Multiple Endings, 2000s, Singleplayer. Greenlight will surface alongside Game Dev Tycoon, Software Inc., The Movies, and Civilization on Steam's recommendation algorithm.

**Nintendo Switch**: Strong secondary. Management sims perform exceptionally on Switch — the "one more turn" loop is perfect for handheld sessions. The lower graphical demands of a UI-driven game make the port straightforward.

**Mobile (tablet)**: Stretch platform. The tap-to-decide interface translates naturally to touch. The session loop supports mobile play patterns. This is a long-tail revenue opportunity if the core game proves out.

---

## THE SCOPE

### Feature Pillars (Non-Negotiable)

1. **THE GREENLIGHT TABLE** — The core decision interface where pitches arrive and fates are decided. 50+ unique studio/game combinations at launch, with each pitch procedurally modified by era conditions, studio morale, and your publisher's reputation. The table must feel like opening a mystery box every quarter — anticipation, evaluation, commitment.

2. **THE STUDIO RELATIONSHIP WEB** — 12-15 persistent AI studio entities across four archetypes (Visionary, Reliable, Volatile, Fading), each with morale, trust, grudge, and reputation states that evolve over the full campaign. Studios must feel like people, not content dispensers. They remember. They talk. They leave.

3. **THE INTERVENTION SYSTEM** — 15-20 named intervention actions (Force Multiplayer, Demand Sequel Hook, Cut Features, Expand Scope, Change Art Direction, Ship Early, Delay to Polish, Mandate DLC Plan, Attach Licensed IP, Fire the Lead Designer, Increase Marketing Budget, Reduce Scope to Handheld, Port to Next-Gen, Cancel Project, Greenlight Expansion Pack) with specific, visible tradeoffs in budget, timeline, morale, and quality. Interventions are the verbs of ongoing management.

4. **THE ERA ENGINE** — A 7-10 year campaign spanning 2003-2012, with each year introducing historically-grounded industry shifts (online multiplayer expectations, next-gen console launches, casual gaming explosion, digital distribution, DLC economy, mobile disruption, the rise of Metacritic's influence) that alter which genres sell, which platforms matter, and which strategies work. The era is not backdrop. It is a core system that reshapes the decision space every year.

5. **THE PORTFOLIO MATRIX** — The three-axis scoring system (Prestige, Profit, Populism) that tracks your publisher's identity and determines board satisfaction, studio attraction, and available options. The matrix must create genuine tension — you cannot maximize all three, and the attempt to balance them IS the strategic game.

### Stretch Goals (ordered by impact)

1. **FRANCHISE SYSTEM** — Successful games can spawn sequels, spin-offs, and transmedia (movie deals, merchandise). Managing a franchise across installments adds a long-term strategic layer: when to sequel, when to reboot, when to let a series rest.

2. **EXECUTIVE SKILL TREE** — Your publisher avatar gains experience and unlocks passive abilities: better gut-feel accuracy, cheaper interventions, studio morale buffs, focus group reliability improvements. Creates a meta-progression across playthroughs.

3. **RIVAL PUBLISHERS** — 2-3 AI-controlled competing publishers who bid on studios, compete for platform exclusivity deals, and react to your portfolio strategy. Adds a competitive dimension to the market simulation.

4. **E3 SHOWFLOOR MINIGAME** — An interactive sequence where you allocate booth space, choose which games to demo, script press conferences, and react to competitor reveals in real time. The E3 of 2005-2009 was the industry's Super Bowl and deserves its own mechanic.

5. **DEVELOPER DOCUMENTARY MODE** — After completing a campaign, unlock a "making of" retrospective that presents your playthrough as a documentary about your publisher's legacy, complete with fake developer interviews referencing your decisions.

6. **SANDBOX MODE** — Unlimited budget, no board pressure, all studios available. For players who want to explore the systems without the campaign's constraints.

### Cut List (NOT in v1)

- **Playing the games you greenlight**: You never control the actual gameplay. You see milestone builds as screenshots and short clips. You are the publisher, not the player. This boundary is sacred — crossing it would destroy the thematic core.
- **Real studio and game names**: The entire roster is fictional. Legal reasons, but also creative ones — fictional studios can behave in ways real ones can't, and players project their own industry knowledge onto the archetypes.
- **Multiplayer or competitive modes**: This is a single-player narrative management experience. The stories it generates are personal.
- **Procedurally generated studio pitches with no authored backbone**: Every pitch has an authored core concept and narrative arc. Procedural systems modify context and details, but the creative DNA of each game-within-a-game is hand-crafted.
- **Real-time gameplay**: This is a turn-based, phase-structured game. Real-time elements would undermine the deliberate, weighty decision-making that defines the experience.
- **Post-2012 era content**: The campaign ends before the free-to-play and live-service revolution. That's a sequel.

## Key Art / Mood Direction

**Hero image**: A mahogany conference table shot from above, scattered with pitch documents, focus group reports, and a half-drunk coffee mug. At the center, a single greenlight button glows — a physical, satisfying, stamp-like mechanism with a green light ring. Around the table's edges, barely visible: the silhouettes of studio representatives leaning in, waiting. One is confident, arms crossed. One is nervous, gripping a USB drive. One is desperate, hands flat on the table. The executive's hand hovers over the button. The moment before the decision. Everything is at stake and nothing has happened yet.

**Color palette**:
- **Primary**: Publisher Green `#2D8C3C` — the greenlight itself, institutional and authoritative
- **Secondary**: Corporate Navy `#1A2744` — boardroom walls, suit jackets, quarterly reports
- **Accent Warm**: Ambition Gold `#D4A843` — studio passion, award statuettes, successful launches
- **Accent Cool**: Metacritic Teal `#00CE7A` — review scores, critical reception, the number that haunts you
- **Danger**: Budget Red `#C62828` — overruns, cancellations, the kill order
- **Neutral**: Spreadsheet Gray `#B0BEC5` — the data layer, the corporate fog between you and the humans
- **Highlight**: E3 Electric Blue `#2979FF` — spectacle, announcements, the industry's showtime

**UI mood**: A 2005 corporate intranet given an eerie beauty. Think Microsoft Outlook's inbox structure for your email correspondence with studios. Excel-style spreadsheets for budget tracking, but with subtle animations — cells that pulse red when a project bleeds money, progress bars that stutter when morale drops. PowerPoint-style pitch decks that studios send you, each with a distinct visual personality (the indie studio's pitch has hand-drawn art and typos; the sequel factory's pitch is a polished corporate template with a mission statement). The Greenlight Table itself is the centerpiece — a physical, almost ritualistic interface where you stamp approvals on documents that represent years of someone's life. Calendar views, Gantt charts, org charts. The beauty of bureaucracy made legible.

**Audio mood**: Corporate ambience with emotional undertones. The hum of fluorescent lights in an empty conference room. A projector fan whirring during a pitch. Keyboard clicks when reviewing emails. The satisfying THUNK of the greenlight stamp. Underneath it all, a subtle orchestral score that shifts with your portfolio's health — major key and confident when you're hitting targets, minor key and anxious when the board is circling. Studio pitch scenes have their own musical signatures: the auteur studio's pitch is scored with avant-garde strings, the sequel factory's with reliable pop-rock, the indie studio's with lo-fi acoustic guitar. The E3 sequence gets its own bombastic, trailer-music crescendo.

**Reference touchstones**: The corporate aesthetics of Severance (Apple TV+). The information density of Football Manager's interface. The period-specific design language of a 2005 IGN review page. The satisfying physicality of stamping documents in Papers Please. The warm nostalgia of booting up a Windows XP machine and hearing the startup chime.

## Open Questions and Next Steps

### Design Questions [REED]

- What's the right number of active project slots? Too few and the player feels constrained without strategic depth; too many and the management becomes overwhelming. Current instinct: 4-6 active projects with 2-3 greenlight slots per quarter.
- How transparent should the quality prediction be? If the player can perfectly forecast Metacritic, the greenlight decision loses tension. If it's too opaque, it feels random. The "gut feel" indicator needs calibration — it should be directionally correct but never precise.
- How does the Intervention System interact with studio archetypes? A "Force Multiplayer" intervention should devastate an Auteur studio's morale but barely register for a Sequel Machine. Every intervention needs a per-archetype response matrix.
- What's the failure state? Can the player be fired? If so, how does that interact with the campaign structure? Current thinking: the board gives warnings (yellow cards) before termination, and termination triggers an epilogue showing what happened to your studios after you left.
- How does the economy scale across the era? Budgets in 2003 and budgets in 2012 are fundamentally different. The Era Engine needs to inflate costs, revenue expectations, and board targets to match historical reality.

### Narrative Questions [NOVA]

- How personal should the studio relationships get? The game is strongest when the player feels the human cost of their decisions — but the executive's distance from the development floor is thematically essential. Where does the player crack the corporate shell?
- What's the emotional climax? The final earnings call is the mechanical climax, but the emotional one might be smaller — a letter from a studio head you championed, or the discovery that a game you cancelled would have been a masterpiece.
- How do we handle the darker side of 2000s publishing? Crunch, studio closures, IP disputes. The game should acknowledge these without being preachy. The player should be able to cause harm through negligence or ambition and feel the weight of it without a morality meter wagging its finger.
- Who is the player character when no one's watching? What do they want? What do they need? What's the lie they tell themselves? Current sketch: they tell themselves they're a patron of the arts, but what they really want is control. The game slowly reveals that the greenlight chair is a throne built on other people's labor.

### Marketing Questions [HYPE]

- When do we announce? The concept has immediate hook potential. A reveal trailer structured as a greenlight meeting — the player watching pitches, stamping approvals, watching consequences unfold — would stop every scroll. The mid-2000s nostalgia angle is a powerful differentiator.
- What's the demo scope? A single fiscal year with 3 studios, 6 pitches, and 2 major era events. Enough to demonstrate the greenlight-intervene-consequence loop and leave players desperate for the full campaign.
- How do we position against Game Dev Tycoon? Not as a competitor — as a complementary perspective. Game Dev Tycoon is the developer fantasy. Greenlight is the publisher fantasy. "You've made the games. Now decide which ones deserve to exist."
- Community strategy: Start a devlog series called "Greenlight Diaries" structured as fictional memos from a publisher executive. Build the world before the game exists. Let the audience roleplay the premise before they can play it.
- Festival strategy: Steam Next Fest is the priority. The game's hook is immediately communicable in a 30-second capsule trailer. Secondary: Day of the Devs, PAX, GDC (the game industry audience will lose their minds over this premise at GDC).

### Next Steps

1. Paper prototype the Greenlight Table with 6 studio profiles and 12 pitch cards. Test the core decision tension: does it feel meaningful to choose between pitches?
2. Design the Studio Archetype matrix: 4 archetypes, each with 3-4 personality variants, morale response curves, and intervention sensitivity profiles.
3. Build the Era Engine timeline: map every major industry event from 2003-2012 to a systemic modifier (genre demand shifts, platform install base changes, revenue model disruptions).
4. Write the opening sequence: the inherited cancellation decision. This is the game's first impression and its thesis statement. It must be perfect.
5. Prototype the Portfolio Matrix on a spreadsheet: simulate 10 fiscal years of greenlight decisions and verify that the Prestige/Profit/Populism tension creates genuine strategic dilemmas.
6. Mood art: one image of the Greenlight Table, one image of a studio pitch screen, one image of the quarterly earnings call. These three images communicate the entire game.
7. Steam page goes live the moment the Greenlight Table interface is screenshot-ready. The capsule image is the greenlight stamp on a pitch document. The short description writes itself.

*This pitch document was generated by REED (Game Designer), NOVA (Narrative Designer), and HYPE (Marketing). The game lives or dies on one question: can the act of funding someone else's creative vision feel as compelling as creating something yourself? If the greenlight stamp carries weight — if the player hesitates before bringing it down, every single time — then Greenlight is the management sim that finally makes you feel something you can't spreadsheet away.*
