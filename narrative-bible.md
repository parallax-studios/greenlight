# GREENLIGHT -- Narrative Bible

*Authored by NOVA, Narrative Designer*

*Every mechanic tells a story. The question is whether you're telling the right one. In GREENLIGHT, the story is this: you are the gate between someone's dream and someone's paycheck, and the gate has a weight that never gets lighter. This bible is the soul of that gate.*

---

## 1. THE WORLD'S WOUND

Every compelling world has a scar. Find it, and you find the story. GREENLIGHT's scar runs deep -- it is the distance between the person who creates and the person who permits creation. That distance is sometimes a canyon and sometimes a hair's width, but it never closes. Not fully. Not even when you want it to.

### Defining Event

**The Collapse of Orion Interactive (2002)**

Two years before the game begins, the publisher you now lead -- **Stonebridge Entertainment** -- was a mid-tier games publisher with a comfortable catalog of licensed tie-ins and modest original IPs. Then your predecessor, **Martin Hayle**, greenlit the most ambitious project in the company's history: *Horizon Protocol*, a massively multiplayer online RPG developed by **Orion Interactive**, a 200-person studio that had never shipped anything larger than a 15-hour action game.

Hayle believed. The board believed. For 18 months, milestone reports glowed with promise. Then the engine collapsed. Then the lead programmer quit. Then the morale reports stopped coming. Then the budget doubled. Then the press found out.

*Horizon Protocol* shipped broken, scored a 41 on Metacritic, and sold 80,000 copies against a $60 million investment. Orion Interactive shuttered within six months. 200 developers lost their jobs. Hayle resigned before the board could fire him. The industry press ran the story for weeks, with the headline everyone remembers: **"Who Greenlit This?"**

That question -- accusatory, bewildered, unanswerable -- is the defining wound of the world. It hangs over every decision the player makes. It is the ghost in the conference room. Every time you reach for the greenlight stamp, you feel the weight of what happens when that stamp lands on the wrong page.

### Central Tension

**Commerce versus art, played out through the bodies of people who are in neither camp.**

The studios are the artists. The board is the commerce. You are in the middle, and the middle is where people get crushed. The central tension is not "money vs. creativity" in the abstract -- it is the specific, granular, quarterly reality of choosing between a game that will sell and a game that deserves to exist. Sometimes those are the same game. Usually they are not. And the people who pay the price for your miscalculation are never you. They are the 200 people at Orion Interactive who are now updating their LinkedIn profiles.

What does the player FEEL here? They feel the vertigo of consequence without control. You can greenlight a game but you cannot make it good. You can fund a dream but you cannot dream it for them. The tension is the gap between your power and your impotence -- and the slow realization that the gap is where all the damage happens.

### The Big Lie

**"Good taste protects you."**

The world of GREENLIGHT believes -- and the player will initially believe -- that if you are smart enough, perceptive enough, and tasteful enough, you can predict which games will succeed. That greenlight decisions are fundamentally knowable. That the 41-scoring disaster and the 92-scoring masterpiece were foreseeable, and that the executive who funds the masterpiece is a visionary while the one who funds the disaster is a fool.

The lie cracks slowly. The player will greenlight a game that looks perfect on paper -- great studio, strong concept, favorable market -- and watch it implode for reasons no spreadsheet could have predicted. They will reluctantly fund a desperate pitch from a struggling team and watch it become the game of the year. The lie doesn't shatter all at once. It erodes. By the late game, the player understands that greenlighting is not prediction. It is faith expressed through budget allocation. And faith, by definition, cannot protect you.

### Texture of the World

Where does the world crack? In the seams between the corporate and the human.

**It smells like**: Reheated coffee in a conference room at 7 PM. Dry-erase markers. The particular plastic-and-ozone scent of a projector running too hot. Someone's takeout left in the break room fridge too long.

**It sounds like**: The white-noise hum of fluorescent lights in an empty hallway after everyone else has gone home. The rhythmic click of a Newton's cradle on your desk. The muffled, tinny audio of a studio's vertical slice demo playing through laptop speakers in a conference room designed for a proper sound system. The mechanical THUNK of the greenlight stamp -- satisfying, irreversible, and slightly too loud.

**It feels like**: The smooth, cold surface of a mahogany conference table under your forearms. The weight of a pitch binder in your hands -- thicker than it should be, because the studio included concept art they were proud of. The specific anxiety of reading an email from a studio head that starts with "I wanted to reach out personally" -- because that sentence never precedes good news.

**It looks like**: Frosted glass and corporate navy. PowerPoint decks with too many transition effects. An inbox that never reaches zero. A calendar with no white space. The green glow of the greenlight button reflected in the glass of a framed cover art from your first hit. A whiteboard in the conference room with "FY06 PORTFOLIO STRATEGY" written in blue marker and never erased, even though it's 2007 now.

## 2. WORLD-BUILDING

### Geography

The world of GREENLIGHT is not a map. It is a series of rooms, screens, and interfaces -- each with a personality, each telling a story about where power lives.

**The Executive Office**
Your office. Frosted glass door, your name etched in it. A mahogany desk too big for one person. Bookshelves with industry awards you inherited from Hayle (do you keep them displayed or put them in a drawer? the player decides). A Newton's cradle that clicks softly during loading screens. A window overlooking a parking lot that you never look through because you are always looking at a screen. This is where you read emails, review milestone reports, and sit alone with the consequences of decisions you made months ago. The office is comfortable and isolating. It is a throne room for an empire made of spreadsheets.

**The Greenlight Table**
The conference room where pitches happen. A long mahogany table. A projector that takes 30 seconds to warm up, during which you and the studio representatives sit in awkward silence. The greenlight stamp sits at the head of the table -- a physical, heavy, green-lit mechanism that the player brings down onto pitch documents. The table is where power is exercised. It is ceremonial. It is also where human beings sit across from you and beg you to believe in them, and you can see the sweat on their hands.

**The Board Room**
Quarterly earnings calls happen here. Bigger table. Bigger screen. No projector warmth-up delay because the board has better equipment than the studios do -- which tells you everything about where this world's priorities lie. The Board Room is a courtroom where you are always on trial. The data on the screen is the evidence. Your portfolio is the verdict.

**The Inbox**
Not a room, but the most emotionally loaded space in the game. Studio emails arrive here. Some are formal milestone submissions. Some are desperate personal messages from studio heads. Some are passive-aggressive notes from lead designers who disagree with your interventions. Some are thank-you letters that arrive months after a game ships. The inbox is where the human cost of your decisions becomes text on a screen, and the player must decide how much of that text to read and how much to leave marked as unread.

**The Industry (Off-Screen)**
E3 convention halls. GDC panels. Studio offices you never visit. The development floors where crunch is happening. Award ceremony stages. Retail store shelves. These spaces exist in the game's narrative but are never directly seen. The player experiences them through reports, emails, news tickers, and the rare photograph attached to a milestone review. This absence is thematic. You are the publisher. You are not in the room where the game is being made. That distance is both your privilege and your punishment.

### History

The history of GREENLIGHT's world is the history of the real game industry, filtered through fictional entities. The key events are:

**1996-2001: The Golden Age of Stonebridge**
Under its founder, **Eleanor Voss**, Stonebridge Entertainment was a prestige publisher known for championing risky original IPs. Voss greenlit games based on gut instinct and personal relationships with developers. Three of her bets became franchise juggernauts. The industry called her "The Patron." She retired in 2001, handing the reins to Martin Hayle.

**2001-2002: The Hayle Years**
Hayle, a former CFO, brought "rigor" to Stonebridge. He replaced Voss's gut-instinct model with data-driven greenlight processes -- focus groups, market analysis, projected ROI calculations. For one year, it worked. Then he greenlit *Horizon Protocol* based on projected subscriber revenue models that assumed 500,000 MMO subscriptions. The data was sound. The game was not.

**2003: The Collapse**
*Horizon Protocol* ships and fails. Orion Interactive closes. Hayle resigns. The board appoints the player as the new head of publishing. The company is wounded, the industry is watching, and the first thing on your desk is a kill order for the project Hayle left behind.

**2003-2012: The Player's Era**
This is the canvas. Everything from here is shaped by the player's decisions, but the industry events are fixed: the shift to online multiplayer, the Xbox 360 launch, the Wii disruption, the rise of digital distribution, the DLC economy, the mobile revolution. History is the weather. The player decides whether to bring an umbrella or dance in the rain.

### Culture

**The Industry's Social Contract**
There is an unspoken agreement in this world: publishers provide money and distribution; studios provide talent and vision. The agreement is unspoken because speaking it aloud reveals how unequal it is. The publisher can survive a failed game. The studio often cannot. This asymmetry defines every relationship in the game and the player must decide whether to exploit it, mitigate it, or pretend it does not exist.

**Studio Culture Archetypes**
Studios in GREENLIGHT are not monoliths. Each has a culture that determines how they respond to your decisions:
- **Visionary studios** live for the work. They over-scope, over-promise, and occasionally over-deliver in ways that redefine genres. They resent intervention because they see it as interference with art.
- **Reliable studios** live for the craft. They ship on time, on budget, and at a consistent quality floor. They welcome clear direction and measurable targets. They rarely surprise you, which is both their strength and their ceiling.
- **Volatile studios** live on the edge. Small teams with enormous talent and no institutional memory. Every project is a coin flip between brilliance and catastrophe. They need mentorship but reject management.
- **Fading studios** live on reputation. They made the hits of the '90s but the industry has moved past them. They need either a reinvention or a graceful ending, and they will accept neither willingly.

**The Metacritic Religion**
By the mid-2000s, review scores have become the industry's shared scripture. Metacritic averages determine bonuses, studio valuations, and publisher reputations. This world worships a number, and the number is calculated by people who played the game for 15 hours and wrote 800 words about it. The absurdity is visible. The power is real. The player will learn to fear and court that number in equal measure.

### Rules of the World

- **Money is finite.** You have a quarterly budget. Every greenlight costs money. Every intervention costs money. The board replenishes budget based on performance, but there is never enough for every good pitch. Scarcity is the engine of drama.
- **Time is irreversible.** Greenlights cannot be un-greenlit without a formal cancellation, which damages studio relationships and costs a "kill fee." Interventions cannot be reversed. Shipped games cannot be unshipped. The player lives with every decision forever.
- **Reputation is currency.** Studios talk to each other. Cancel a game cruelly and future pitches dry up. Champion a struggling team and better studios seek you out. Reputation is invisible until it isn't -- and by then it's too late to repair.
- **Quality is unknowable.** The player can estimate a game's quality through gut instinct, milestone reviews, and focus group data, but the final Metacritic score is never fully predictable. There is always a margin of chaos. This is not a design flaw. This is the point.
- **People are not resources.** Studio morale is a number on a screen, but it represents human beings working 80-hour weeks because you demanded a feature they didn't believe in. The game never lets the player forget this, even as it lets them do it anyway.

### Secrets

Things the world hides. Things the player discovers through play.

- **Eleanor Voss is still watching.** The founder of Stonebridge never fully left. She sits on the board as a silent observer. She never speaks in board meetings -- until Year 5 or later, when she sends the player a single, personal email. What it says depends on how you've run the company. If you've been a patron of the arts, she thanks you. If you've been a profit machine, she asks you one question: "Do you remember why we started this company?" If you've been balanced, she says nothing -- but she votes in your favor at the next board meeting. Voss is the conscience the player didn't know they had.
- **The Horizon Protocol postmortem exists.** Buried in the company archives (accessible from Year 3 onward if the player explores their file system), there is a full postmortem document from the Orion Interactive collapse. Reading it reveals that Hayle was warned three times by the studio's lead designer that the scope was untenable. Hayle's response each time was "Expand Scope." The player realizes they have access to the same intervention button. The question is whether they will press it.
- **The industry remembers Orion.** If the player cancels a project from a struggling studio, a news ticker will occasionally reference the cancellation alongside the Orion Interactive closure. The industry has a long memory. Your predecessors' sins become context for your own decisions.
- **One studio is an Orion survivor.** Among the Volatile studio archetypes, one small team -- **Ember Works** -- is staffed by former Orion Interactive developers. They never mention it in their pitches. The player discovers it only through a late-game email chain or a milestone report that references "lessons learned from our last publisher." If the player champions Ember Works, their late-game magnum opus pitch references *Horizon Protocol* directly -- they want to make the game Orion was trying to make, but correctly this time. Greenlighting it is the most expensive, most risky, and most emotionally loaded decision in the game.

## 3. CHARACTERS

### The Player Character: THE EXECUTIVE

**Name**: Unnamed. The player. Referred to in third person by others as "the new head of publishing" or simply "you."

**Role**: Head of Publishing at Stonebridge Entertainment.

**Desire**: To build a legacy. To be remembered as the person who greenlit the games that mattered.

**Need**: To accept that legacy is not control. That the best thing a publisher can do is trust, fund, and get out of the way -- and that this act of surrender is harder than any intervention.

**Wound**: They inherited the chair from a man whose legacy is failure. They carry Hayle's ghost in every decision. They are terrified of being the next person the industry asks "Who greenlit this?" about.

**Lie**: "If I'm smart enough, I can predict what will succeed." The lie of control. The lie of the gatekeeper who believes the gate protects rather than restricts.

**Arc**: From gatekeeper to gardener. Early game: the player uses the greenlight stamp like a weapon, asserting control. Mid-game: the player begins to realize that their best outcomes came from restraint, from trusting studios they believed in. Late game: the player either becomes a patron (funding art, accepting risk, building trust) or a tyrant (demanding sequels, forcing interventions, optimizing metrics). The game allows both. The epilogue reflects which path they chose.

**Voice**: Silent protagonist. The player's voice is expressed through their decisions. But the game's UI has personality -- loading screen tooltips, notification phrasings, and the greenlight stamp's mechanical feedback all reflect the tone of the player's accumulated choices.

**Gameplay Function**: The player IS the player character. Every mechanic is an expression of their role. The greenlight stamp is their verb. The inbox is their conscience. The board room is their judgment.

---

### Martin Hayle -- THE PREDECESSOR

**Name**: Martin Hayle

**Role**: Former Head of Publishing at Stonebridge. Resigned in disgrace after the *Horizon Protocol* disaster.

**Desire**: He wanted to modernize Stonebridge. To replace Eleanor Voss's gut-instinct model with data-driven rigor. To prove that publishing could be a science, not an art.

**Need**: He needed to admit that data without judgment is just noise. That the spreadsheet cannot tell you whether a team has the soul to ship the thing they are promising.

**Wound**: He was a CFO who was promoted to a creative role and never stopped being a CFO. The industry's mockery after *Horizon Protocol* didn't wound him because he was wrong about the data -- the data was sound. It wounded him because being right about the data and wrong about the game proved that the thing he valued most was insufficient.

**Lie**: "The numbers don't lie." They don't. But they don't tell the whole truth either.

**Arc**: Hayle does not appear in person. He exists through artifacts: the kill order on your desk, the archived emails in the company system, the *Horizon Protocol* postmortem, and a single email he sends in Year 4 if the player has been especially data-driven. The email reads: "I see you're using the focus group weighting model I built. It works. Until it doesn't. You'll know the difference when it's too late. -- M.H." Hayle is a cautionary tale who never becomes a caricature. He was not stupid. He was not evil. He was insufficient.

**Voice**: Clinical. Precise. Emails written in complete sentences with proper punctuation. No contractions. No exclamation marks. The kind of prose that sounds professional until you realize there is no person behind it.

*Sample dialogue (archived email):*
> "The Q3 milestone review for Horizon Protocol indicates a 14% budget overrun, which falls within acceptable variance for a project of this scope. Studio morale is rated at 6.2/10, down from 7.1 last quarter. I have authorized the 'Expand Scope' intervention to accommodate the team's request for an additional six months of pre-production on the multiplayer subsystem. The projected ROI remains favorable at current subscriber estimates. I see no cause for concern at this time."

**Gameplay Function**: The ghost in the machine. Hayle's decisions created the starting conditions of the game. His archived documents provide context, warnings, and a mirror for the player's own choices. He is the version of you that already failed.

---

### Eleanor Voss -- THE FOUNDER

**Name**: Eleanor Voss

**Role**: Founder of Stonebridge Entertainment. Retired board member. The Patron.

**Desire**: She wanted to build a company that proved games were art worth funding. That a publisher could be a patron, not just a distributor.

**Need**: She needed to accept that the company she built would outlive her vision of it. That institutions change, and the best she could do was plant seeds, not control the harvest.

**Wound**: She watched Hayle dismantle her culture of creative trust and replace it with spreadsheets. She could have fought it. She chose to step back instead, and the guilt of that silence haunts her.

**Lie**: "I should have stayed." The truth is that her model was also flawed -- she greenlit too many passion projects that failed quietly, and the company was financially vulnerable before Hayle ever arrived. The Patron was not a sustainable business model. But she will never admit this.

**Arc**: Voss is silent for most of the game. She sits on the board. She votes but does not speak. Then, in the late game, she reaches out -- once. A single email. The content depends on the player's tenure. Her arc is completed by the player's choices, not her own. She is a mirror, not an actor.

**Voice**: Warm but precise. She writes the way people speak when they have thought about every word but want it to sound effortless. Short sentences. Occasional dry humor. A fondness for questions she already knows the answer to.

*Sample dialogue (late-game email, Patron path):*
> "I watched your E3 press conference. The part where you showed the Ember Works trailer and the audience went quiet -- not bored quiet, the other kind. I built this company for moments like that. Thank you for remembering what it was for."

*Sample dialogue (late-game email, Profit path):*
> "The quarterly numbers are impressive. The board is thrilled. I have one question, and I would appreciate an honest answer, though I suspect I won't get one: when you greenlight a game now, do you think about the game, or do you think about the number?"

**Gameplay Function**: The conscience. Voss represents the player's relationship with the company's founding values. Her late-game email is one of the most emotionally significant moments in the game -- a judgment from the person who built the thing you now control. Players who never explore the company archives may never fully understand who she is, which is intentional. She rewards curiosity.

---

### Tomoko Sato -- THE AUTEUR

**Name**: Tomoko Sato

**Role**: Creative Director of **Cathedral Studios** (Visionary archetype). The most talented and most difficult studio head in your roster.

**Desire**: To make the game she sees in her head. Completely. Without compromise. She wants *Lithograph*, a narrative-driven action game about grief rendered through architectural metaphor, and she wants every pixel of it to be exactly as she imagined.

**Need**: She needs to learn that collaboration is not compromise. That the publisher's constraints can be a crucible, not a cage. That the game she makes with limitations might be stronger than the one she makes without them.

**Wound**: Her first game was gutted by a previous publisher who forced multiplayer into a single-player experience. It reviewed poorly. She has never forgiven the industry for it, and she treats every publisher interaction as a potential betrayal.

**Lie**: "No one who holds the money can be trusted with the art."

**Arc**: If the player intervenes aggressively with Cathedral Studios, Sato's morale craters and she eventually leaves, taking her team to a rival publisher and making *Lithograph* without you. It reviews brilliantly. You see the Metacritic score in your news feed and feel the specific pain of having lost something you could have had. If the player shows restraint -- greenlighting *Lithograph* at full budget with zero interventions -- Sato delivers either a masterpiece or a beautiful disaster, depending on factors the player cannot fully control. If the player earns her trust across multiple projects before *Lithograph*, she accepts one -- exactly one -- intervention suggestion, and the resulting game is the highest-quality outcome possible. Trust, not control, produces the best result. Every mechanic tells a story.

**Voice**: Terse. Poetic. She speaks in short, declarative sentences that sound like thesis statements. She does not use filler words. She does not explain herself unless pressed, and when pressed she speaks in metaphors. She is exhausting and magnetic.

*Sample dialogue (pitch meeting):*
> "The game is called *Lithograph*. It is about a woman who builds a cathedral to house a grief she cannot name. The player builds the cathedral. The architecture is the narrative. Every room is a memory. Every collapsed wall is a memory the character is not ready to face. I don't need notes. I need eighteen months and a team of forty."

*Sample dialogue (milestone review, if morale is high):*
> "The vertical slice is attached. It is not what I imagined. It is better. The physics system does something with light that I did not plan, and I have rewritten the second act around it. We are on schedule. Do not call me for six weeks."

*Sample dialogue (milestone review, if morale is low -- post-intervention):*
> "The multiplayer prototype is functional. I am told it tests well. I would not know. I stopped playing it after the third focus session. The game I am making is not the game I pitched. I assume that is acceptable to you. It always is."

**Gameplay Function**: The high-risk, high-reward studio relationship. Sato tests the player's philosophy: do you trust artists, or do you manage them? She is the player's clearest mirror for the commerce-vs-art tension. She is also the source of the game's highest potential Metacritic score -- but only on a path that requires the player to surrender control. She is the game's thesis statement made flesh.

---

### Doug Meyerowitz -- THE SEQUEL MACHINE

**Name**: Doug Meyerowitz

**Role**: Studio Head of **Ironclad Games** (Reliable archetype). The most commercially successful studio in your roster. Makers of the *Warpath* franchise.

**Desire**: To keep shipping. To keep the studio employed. To keep the *Warpath* franchise alive because it pays the bills and his people have mortgages.

**Need**: He needs to take a creative risk before the *Warpath* formula calcifies. He knows the franchise is slowly dying of sequel fatigue, but he cannot bring himself to jeopardize 200 jobs on an unproven concept.

**Wound**: In 1999, Doug pitched an original IP to a publisher who passed on it and funded a competitor's game instead. The competitor's game sold millions. Doug's original concept was shelved. He started making sequels because sequels get greenlit. The ambition never died; it just went underground.

**Lie**: "Reliability is its own kind of art."

**Arc**: If the player only funds *Warpath* sequels, Doug delivers consistent 78-82 Metacritic scores and solid revenue for years -- until the franchise hits a wall and the scores start sliding. If the player pushes Doug to pitch something original (through a specific intervention: "Request New IP"), Doug hesitantly pitches a game called *Undertow* -- a survival horror title about a submarine crew, nothing like anything he's ever made. It is either the reinvention that saves Ironclad or the risk that breaks them. The player's history of trust with Doug determines which outcome is more likely.

**Voice**: Casual. Warm. Self-deprecating. Doug talks like a guy who'd buy you a beer. He uses sports metaphors. He calls you by your first name before you've given him permission. He is the easiest studio head to like and the hardest to push.

*Sample dialogue (pitch meeting, Warpath sequel):*
> "Hey, you know the drill. *Warpath IV*. Same team, same engine, new campaign. We're thinking modern-day setting this time -- focus groups are tired of World War II. Budget's in line with last time, maybe 10% bump for the new lighting system. We'll ship Q4, hit the holiday window, and bank another solid one. Nothing flashy. Nothing broken. Just Ironclad doing what Ironclad does."

*Sample dialogue (pitch meeting, Undertow -- if trust is high):*
> "So, uh. This is different. I've been sitting on this for... I don't know, eight years? It's called *Undertow*. Submarine. Survival horror. Three-person crew. Sonar is the only way to see, and what you see is -- look, I know this isn't what you expect from me. I know my track record is sequels. But this thing has been living in my head since before *Warpath* existed, and I think... I think if I don't make it now, I never will. I just need someone to say yes."

*Sample dialogue (milestone review, Warpath sequel):*
> "Build's on track. Metacritic prediction: 79, same as last time. Morale's fine. Not excited, but fine. The team knows this engine like the back of their hand. We'll ship clean. Anything else you need from us?"

**Gameplay Function**: The safe bet. Doug is the player's comfort zone -- consistent revenue, predictable quality, zero drama. He exists to make the player feel secure, so that the decision to push him toward *Undertow* feels genuinely risky. He is also a commentary on the industry's sequel dependency: the player benefits from the *Warpath* franchise until they don't, and the transition from "reliable" to "stagnant" happens so gradually that most players won't notice until it's too late.

### Priya Chandrasekaran -- THE INDIE SPARK

**Name**: Priya Chandrasekaran

**Role**: Lead Designer and co-founder of **Kindling Interactive** (Volatile archetype). A three-person team with more ideas than infrastructure.

**Desire**: To prove that a small team can make something that changes the industry. She wants *Parallax* -- a puzzle game about perspective shifts -- to be the game that makes people take indie development seriously.

**Need**: She needs to accept help without seeing it as control. She needs to learn the difference between a publisher who wants to manage her and a publisher who wants to support her.

**Wound**: Priya was a junior designer at a large studio that was shut down by its publisher after a single failed project. She was laid off with 150 other people via a company-wide email. She started Kindling Interactive the next week because she swore she would never let someone else's quarterly earnings call determine her career again.

**Lie**: "Independence means doing everything alone."

**Arc**: If the player funds Kindling at full budget and leaves them alone, *Parallax* ships as either a sleeper hit or a noble failure -- the margin is narrow and depends on factors the player cannot see. If the player offers gentle mentorship (small interventions phrased as suggestions rather than mandates), Priya's morale holds and the game's quality ceiling rises. If the player micromanages -- demanding features, forcing a platform change, attaching a license -- Priya implodes. She sends a scathing email, cancels the project herself, and Kindling Interactive dissolves. The email becomes an industry news story. Your reputation with Volatile studios drops permanently. The player learns that some studios cannot be managed. They can only be believed in.

**Voice**: Fast. Energetic. Run-on sentences that tumble over each other because her brain moves faster than her mouth. She uses "like" as a filler word. She sends emails at 3 AM with subject lines like "OKAY HEAR ME OUT" and body text that's a single unbroken paragraph. She is 27 years old and has already been through more than most studio heads twice her age.

*Sample dialogue (pitch meeting):*
> "Okay so *Parallax* -- basically imagine you're looking at a room but the room changes depending on where you're standing, like physically the geometry reconfigures based on the player's literal perspective, and we use that as a puzzle mechanic but also as a narrative device because the story is about two characters who experienced the same event but remember it completely differently, and the puzzles are literally about reconciling their perspectives into a shared truth. We have a prototype. It's rough. But it works. Like, the mechanic WORKS. I can show you."

*Sample dialogue (milestone review, if supported):*
> "So the prototype is singing. Like actually singing. We figured out the perspective-shift rendering thing and it's -- I sent you a clip, did you watch it? -- it's this moment where the room literally unfolds and you can see both versions at once and playtesters keep going 'whoa' which is like the exact reaction we wanted. We're still three people and we're sleeping in the office but the game is GOOD. Thank you for not making us add multiplayer."

*Sample dialogue (email, if micromanaged):*
> Subject: We're done.
>
> "I started this studio because I promised myself I'd never let a suit tell me what my game is. I let you fund us because I thought you were different. You're not. You're just Hayle with a friendlier email signature. Kindling Interactive is dissolved as of today. Don't contact us. The prototype belongs to us. You'll hear from our lawyer about the funding agreement. -- Priya"

**Gameplay Function**: The wild card. Priya is the player's test of patience and trust. She produces the most surprising outcomes -- both positive and negative -- and her trajectory is the most sensitive to the player's intervention style. She is also the game's commentary on the publisher-indie relationship: the power asymmetry is enormous, and the player must decide whether to wield that power or restrain it.

### Victor Alhambra -- THE FADING LEGEND

**Name**: Victor Alhambra

**Role**: Founder and Creative Director of **Titan Forge** (Fading archetype). Once the most celebrated studio in PC gaming. Makers of the *Aegis* trilogy, which defined the tactical RPG genre in the late '90s.

**Desire**: To recapture glory. He wants to make *Aegis IV* and prove that the old ways still work. That deep, complex, PC-exclusive tactical RPGs still have an audience in the age of console shooters and casual games.

**Need**: He needs to accept that the industry has changed and that adaptation is not surrender. He needs to find a way to bring the soul of *Aegis* into a new form -- or accept that some legacies are best left complete.

**Wound**: The *Aegis* trilogy sold modestly but was worshipped by a devoted fanbase. When the industry shifted to consoles and streamlined design, Titan Forge was left behind. Victor watched studios half his age get funded for games he considered shallow. The bitterness calcified into stubbornness.

**Lie**: "The audience will come back. They just need to be reminded of what great games look like."

**Arc**: If the player greenlights *Aegis IV* as Victor envisions it -- a pure, uncompromising PC-exclusive tactical RPG with 80 hours of content -- it will be a critical darling and a commercial failure. Prestige rises. Profit craters. The board is unhappy. Victor is grateful. If the player forces modernization -- console port, streamlined mechanics, shorter runtime -- Victor's morale disintegrates and the game ships as a compromised mess that satisfies no one. If the player works with Victor across multiple projects to gradually evolve Titan Forge's approach -- funding smaller experimental projects before tackling *Aegis IV* -- there is a narrow path to a game that honors the legacy and finds a new audience. This path requires the most patience of any studio relationship in the game.

**Voice**: Formal. Measured. Victor speaks in complete paragraphs. He references game design history the way an academic references literature. He is polite but immovable. He uses "one" instead of "you" when being philosophical. He has never sent an email shorter than three paragraphs.

*Sample dialogue (pitch meeting):*
> "Thank you for taking this meeting. I know Titan Forge is not the studio it was. I know the market has shifted. I will not pretend otherwise. But I believe there is still a place for the kind of game we make -- a game that respects the player's intelligence, that rewards patience, that does not hold your hand or apologize for its complexity. *Aegis IV* is that game. The design document is 400 pages. I have brought a summary. I would prefer you read the full document, but I understand that is not how things are done anymore."

*Sample dialogue (milestone review, if morale is high):*
> "The tactical combat system is complete. It is, if I may say so, the finest work this studio has produced. The AI operates on a decision tree of considerable depth -- your testers will not find exploits easily. I have attached a build and a suggested reading order for the accompanying lore codex. Please allocate adequate time for evaluation. This is not a game one can assess in an afternoon."

*Sample dialogue (milestone review, if forced to modernize):*
> "The console port is functional. The control scheme has been adapted. I am told the tutorials are effective. I want you to know that I do not recognize this game. It bears the name *Aegis*, but it is not an *Aegis* game. It is a game shaped like what the market demands, wearing the skin of something that once mattered. I will deliver it. I have always delivered. But I want this email on record: what we are shipping is not what I pitched, and the difference is not a matter of scope. It is a matter of soul."

**Gameplay Function**: The nostalgia trap. Victor is the player's relationship with the past. Funding him is emotionally satisfying but commercially dangerous. He tests whether the player can distinguish between what deserves to exist and what deserves to be funded. He is also the game's most direct commentary on the "games as art" debate: *Aegis IV* is art. The question is whether art pays the bills, and what it means when it doesn't.

### The Board -- THE SYSTEM

**Name**: The Stonebridge Board of Directors (collective entity)

**Role**: The player's employers. The source of budget. The voice of shareholder value.

**Desire**: Profit. Growth. Market share. Shareholder confidence. These are not human desires but institutional ones, which makes them both more predictable and more relentless.

**Need**: The board has no need. It has no arc. It is a system, not a person. This is intentional. The board represents the institutional pressure that the player cannot negotiate with, cannot charm, and cannot change. It can only be satisfied or defied.

**Wound**: The *Horizon Protocol* disaster cost the company $40 million and a year of market confidence. The board's wound is financial, not emotional, and that distinction is the point.

**Lie**: "The numbers tell the whole story."

**Arc**: The board does not change. It adjusts targets. It issues warnings. It grants extensions or imposes cuts. It is the weather -- you cannot argue with it, only navigate it. The board's constancy is what makes Eleanor Voss's eventual email so powerful. When a human voice emerges from the institutional noise, the player feels it because they have been starved of it.

**Voice**: Corporate plural. "We" instead of "I." Bullet points instead of paragraphs. Performance metrics bolded. Deadlines underlined. The board speaks in quarterly reports and official memos. It never uses a first name. It never says "please."

*Sample dialogue (quarterly review):*
> STONEBRIDGE ENTERTAINMENT -- QUARTERLY PERFORMANCE REVIEW
> FY2005 Q3
>
> Portfolio Performance: BELOW TARGET
> -- Prestige Index: 62/100 (target: 70) -- UNDERPERFORMING
> -- Profit Index: 78/100 (target: 75) -- SATISFACTORY
> -- Populism Index: 55/100 (target: 65) -- UNDERPERFORMING
>
> Board Assessment: The current portfolio skews heavily toward commercial performance at the expense of critical reception and mainstream visibility. Two consecutive quarters below Prestige target will trigger a formal review of publishing strategy. The Board recommends diversifying upcoming greenlight decisions toward critically ambitious projects.
>
> Action Items: Review attached studio pitch queue. Allocate minimum one greenlight slot to high-Prestige-potential project in Q4.

**Gameplay Function**: The constraint. The board is the reason the player cannot simply fund every good pitch. It is the source of tension between what the player wants to do and what the player is required to do. It is also the game's most honest representation of the publishing industry: the people who make the creative decisions answer to people who do not care about creativity, and the distance between those two groups is measured in quarterly earnings reports.

## 4. TONE GUIDE

### Adjectives

**Corporate. Intimate. Bittersweet. Specific. Restrained.**

The tone of GREENLIGHT is the tension between corporate sterility and human vulnerability. The surface is professional -- emails, spreadsheets, milestone reports, quarterly reviews. Beneath the surface, people are dreaming, failing, burning out, and hoping. The tone is the gap between the format and the feeling.

### Tone References

- **Severance** (Apple TV+) -- The eerie beauty of corporate spaces. The feeling that something human is trapped inside something institutional.
- **Moneyball** (film) -- The tension between data and intuition. The specific loneliness of the person who makes the unpopular bet.
- **Papers, Please** (game) -- The weight of small decisions made under systemic pressure. The way bureaucracy becomes a moral landscape.
- **Blood, Sweat, and Pixels** by Jason Schreier -- The texture of game development as lived experience. The specificity of crunch, ambition, and compromise.
- **Mad Men** (TV series) -- Period piece that loves its era without romanticizing it. Characters who are brilliant at their jobs and lost in their lives. The loneliness of the corner office.

### Dialogue Rules

- **Formal vs. casual**: Varies by character. Board communications are rigidly formal. Studio heads range from Victor's academic formality to Priya's breathless run-ons to Doug's beer-buddy warmth. The player's own communications (intervention orders, greenlight memos) are template-formal with one-line personal additions that the player chooses.
- **Humor vs. serious**: The humor is dry, situational, and never at the expense of the stakes. Doug cracks jokes. Victor does not. Priya's energy is funny until you realize she's running on anxiety. The game never winks at the player. It takes its world seriously so the player will too.
- **Verbose vs. terse**: Match the character. Sato is terse. Victor is verbose. The board is bureaucratically dense. Emails from struggling studios are short because they don't know what to say. Emails from confident studios are long because they can't stop talking about the work.
- **The Unsaid Rule**: The most emotional moments in GREENLIGHT are conveyed through what is NOT in the text. A studio that stops sending milestone jokes. A morale report that drops from 8 to 3 with no explanation. An email that ends abruptly. The silence between quarterly reports. The game trusts the player to read the gaps.

### What This World Is NOT

- **It is NOT satirical.** The game industry setting is treated with respect and specificity, not as a punchline. The absurdities of publishing are real, and they are presented as real -- not exaggerated for comedy.
- **It is NOT cynical.** Despite the commerce-vs-art tension, the game believes that good games can be made under publisher funding. The system is flawed but not evil. The player is compromised but not villainous.
- **It is NOT a power fantasy.** The early game feels like a power fantasy. The mid-game dismantles it. The late game replaces it with something more complicated and more honest.
- **It is NOT preachy.** There is no morality meter. There is no "good ending" and "bad ending." There are consequences, and the player decides which consequences they can live with. The game presents the weight of decisions without prescribing which decisions are correct.
- **It is NOT nostalgic in a soft-focus way.** The mid-2000s setting is specific and textured, but the game does not romanticize the era. Crunch was real. Studio closures were real. The Metacritic-bonus culture was real. The game loves its era the way *Mad Men* loves the 1960s: with clear eyes and complicated affection.

### Sample Passages

**Opening crawl (first screen of the game):**

> It is November 2003. You have been appointed Head of Publishing at Stonebridge Entertainment, the company that published *Warpath*, *Aegis*, and *Horizon Protocol*. Two of those titles built this company. The third nearly destroyed it.
>
> Your predecessor left a clean desk, a locked filing cabinet, and a single folder marked URGENT. Inside is a kill order for a game that is eighteen months late and twenty-five million dollars over budget. The studio is asking for six more months. The board wants it dead by Friday.
>
> Your signature goes on the order. Or it doesn't.
>
> Welcome to the greenlight chair. The seat is still warm.

**Mid-game email (from a studio whose game just scored 58 on Metacritic):**

> Subject: RE: Q2 Review Scores
>
> I know. I saw the number. My team saw the number. They saw it on their phones at 6 AM because someone on NeoGAF posted the review roundup before the embargo lifted.
>
> I don't have an explanation. The game we shipped is the game we built. We hit every milestone. We addressed every focus group note. We cut the features you asked us to cut. We shipped on time. And the reviewers say it's "competent but uninspired."
>
> Maybe they're right. I don't know anymore. I've been staring at this project for three years and I can't tell if it's good. I lost the ability to judge it somewhere around the second milestone review.
>
> What I need from you right now is to know whether we still have a future at Stonebridge. Not the studio. Me. Personally. Because I put my name on this game and my name now means fifty-eight, and I need to know if you still see something worth funding.
>
> -- R. Vasquez, Studio Head, Brickwork Interactive

**Late-game news ticker (after the player's portfolio shapes the industry):**

> INDUSTRY WIRE -- YEAR-END ROUNDUP 2009: "Stonebridge Entertainment's publishing slate this year represented something increasingly rare in the industry: a coherent vision. Whether you agree with their emphasis on [player's dominant axis] or not, there is no denying that in an era of me-too sequels and risk-averse portfolios, someone at Stonebridge is making choices that feel like they mean something. The question, as always, is whether meaning pays the bills."

## 5. NARRATIVE-MECHANIC INTEGRATION

Every mechanic tells a story. Here is what each mechanic tells.

### The Greenlight Stamp

**Story it tells**: Permission. Power. Irreversibility. The stamp is heavy. The animation is slow. There is a moment of hesitation built into the input -- a slight delay between the player's click and the stamp's descent. In that delay lives the entire emotional thesis of the game. You are about to change someone's life. The stamp does not know if you are right.

### The Intervention System

**Story it tells**: The distance between the funder and the maker. Every intervention is an act of reaching across that distance. "Force Multiplayer" is not a mechanic -- it is a story about an executive who believes they know better than the people doing the work. "Ship Early" is not a budget optimization -- it is a story about someone who decided that "good enough" was good enough, and the people who have to live with that decision. The morale cost of each intervention is not a penalty. It is a human being reacting to being told their vision was insufficient.

### The Portfolio Matrix

**Story it tells**: Identity through accumulated choice. The three axes -- Prestige, Profit, Populism -- are not just scores. They are the answer to the question: what kind of publisher are you? The player does not choose an identity in a character creation screen. They build it, greenlight by greenlight, over years. By the late game, the portfolio matrix IS the player's character arc, expressed in data.

### The Studio Relationship Web

**Story it tells**: Trust is built in inches and destroyed in moments. Studios remembering your past decisions is not a memory system -- it is a story about reputation, loyalty, and betrayal. When Sato's trust meter is high enough for her to accept one intervention, that is not a game state. That is a relationship. The player earned it through years of restraint, and the weight of that earning is the emotional content.

### The Era Engine

**Story it tells**: The world does not wait for you. Historical forces arrive regardless of the player's preparation. The Wii launches whether or not you have a casual game in development. Digital distribution emerges whether or not you have invested in the infrastructure. The era engine tells the story of an industry in upheaval, and the player's role in that story is not to control the upheaval but to navigate it. The feeling is geological: you are standing on tectonic plates, and the plates are moving.

### Environmental Storytelling Opportunities

- **The office evolves.** Early game: the office is sparse, inherited, impersonal. As the player makes decisions, the office fills with artifacts -- framed cover art from shipped games, award statuettes, a stack of unsent kill orders, a photo from an E3 booth. The office becomes a museum of the player's tenure.
- **The inbox tells a parallel story.** Unread emails accumulate. Old emails from dissolved studios sit in the archive. The inbox's scroll depth is a timeline of relationships begun and ended.
- **The greenlight stamp shows wear.** By the late game, the stamp's surface is scuffed, the green light ring is slightly dimmer, the mechanism is slightly looser. The tool has been used. It shows.
- **Loading screens quote the player's own history.** "In 2005, you greenlit 4 games. 2 shipped. 1 was cancelled. 1 is still in development." The loading screen is a mirror.

### How Narrative Reinforces the Core Loop

The core loop is: receive pitch, evaluate, greenlight or pass, manage development, receive consequences. Narrative reinforces this by ensuring that every stage of the loop carries emotional weight:

- **Receive pitch**: The studio's personality, history, and relationship with you are visible in the pitch's tone, format, and content. A pitch from a studio you cancelled last year reads differently than one from a studio whose game you championed to a 90 Metacritic.
- **Evaluate**: The gut-feel indicator is not just a number. It is the player character's instinct, shaped by experience. Early game, it's unreliable. Late game, it's accurate. The player's growing competence is a character arc expressed through a UI element.
- **Greenlight or pass**: The stamp. The delay. The sound. The irreversibility.
- **Manage development**: Milestone reviews are written by characters, not systems. The prose changes based on morale. The data is the same, but the framing is human.
- **Receive consequences**: Metacritic scores arrive as news articles with pull quotes from fictional reviewers. Sales figures arrive as board memos. Studio reactions arrive as personal emails. The consequence is never just a number. It is a number experienced through a human voice.

## 6. LORE HIERARCHY

### Need-to-Know
*The player MUST understand this to play.*

- You are the Head of Publishing at Stonebridge Entertainment.
- Your predecessor's last project was a disaster that nearly killed the company.
- You greenlight games. Studios make them. You manage the process. You are not the developer.
- Your performance is measured on three axes: Prestige, Profit, Populism.
- The board sets targets. Miss them and face consequences.
- Studios have personalities and memories. They respond to how you treat them.
- The game industry is changing. Each year brings new platforms, new trends, new disruptions.

### Want-to-Know
*Enriches the experience for curious players.*

- Martin Hayle's specific failures and philosophy. Why he greenlit *Horizon Protocol* and what it reveals about data-driven publishing.
- Eleanor Voss's founding vision for Stonebridge. What the company was supposed to be.
- Each studio head's personal history, wound, and lie. Why Sato distrusts publishers. Why Doug makes sequels. Why Priya works alone. Why Victor won't adapt.
- The Metacritic-bonus culture and its real human cost.
- The specific industry events of each era year and their historical parallels.
- The Orion Interactive closure and its lingering effects on the industry.

### Deep Lore
*Rewards dedicated fans and lore hunters.*

- The *Horizon Protocol* postmortem document, discoverable in the company archives. Reveals Hayle's three "Expand Scope" decisions and the lead designer's warnings.
- Ember Works' connection to Orion Interactive. Discoverable only through late-game email chains and a careful reading of their studio profile.
- Eleanor Voss's board voting record. If the player accesses board minutes (available from Year 4), they can track how Voss voted on every major decision. Her pattern reveals her values without her ever speaking.
- The "ghost pitch" -- an unfunded pitch document buried in the archives from 2001. It describes a game that sounds exactly like a real landmark title that shipped in 2004 from a different publisher. Stonebridge passed on it. The document is unsigned but the writing style matches Priya Chandrasekaran's early portfolio work. She pitched to Stonebridge before founding Kindling. They said no. She remembers.
- Studio developer credits that reference real game design concepts and historical design movements, rewarding players with industry knowledge.

### Never-Told
*Exists for internal consistency but the player never sees it.*

- Eleanor Voss's financial mismanagement in the late '90s. Her "patron of the arts" model was running the company into the ground before Hayle arrived. He was hired to save the company, not replace a visionary. The board narrative that Hayle ruined Voss's vision is a simplification. The truth is more complicated and more human.
- The board member who personally profited from the *Horizon Protocol* failure through short-selling Stonebridge stock. This never surfaces because the game is about the creative side of publishing, not the financial corruption side. But it explains why the board was slow to cancel *Horizon Protocol* despite clear warning signs.
- Tomoko Sato's first game -- the one gutted by a previous publisher -- was published by a company that Stonebridge later acquired. The IP rights to Sato's original vision are technically owned by Stonebridge. Sato does not know this. If she did, it would fundamentally alter her relationship with the player. This knowledge exists to ensure that the narrative team understands the full web of connections, but surfacing it would introduce a plot thread that distracts from the core theme.
- Victor Alhambra turned down an acquisition offer from a major platform holder in 2001 that would have guaranteed Titan Forge's financial security for a decade. He refused because the deal required exclusivity. This decision is the real reason Titan Forge is fading, but Victor has rewritten the story in his head: in his version, the industry abandoned him. In truth, he abandoned the industry's lifeline out of pride. This never surfaces because Victor's arc is about adaptation, not about relitigating the past.

### In-Game Campaign

| Year | Industry Event | Narrative Beat |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| 2003 | PS2 dominance, early online multiplayer | **The Inheritance.** Player's first decision: the kill order. First greenlight cycle with 3-4 studios pitching. Establishing relationships. Learning the systems. |
| 2004 | Online multiplayer becomes standard. GTA: San Andreas effect on open-world demand | **The First Ship.** Player's first greenlit game launches. First Metacritic score. First consequence. First studio reaction email. The moment the player realizes that greenlighting was the easy part. |
| 2005 | Xbox 360 launches. Next-gen transition begins. | **The Platform Gamble.** Do you pivot to next-gen or ride the PS2's massive install base? Studios begin pitching next-gen projects. Budget expectations rise. The first genuine strategic dilemma of the campaign. |
| 2006 | Wii launches. Casual gaming explodes. PS3 launches at $599. | **The Disruption.** The board demands a casual gaming response. Studios that built their identity on "hardcore" games are asked to adapt. Sato pitches *Lithograph*. The player's first truly agonizing greenlight decision. |
| 2007 | Digital distribution platforms emerge. Metacritic's influence peaks. | **The Shift.** Revenue models begin changing. Studios ask about DLC. The board introduces new metrics. The player's early greenlights are now shipping, and the portfolio's identity is becoming visible. Mid-game emotional peak. |
| 2008 | DLC economy formalizes. Economic recession hits. | **The Crunch.** Budgets tighten. The board demands cost cuts. A studio the player believed in is struggling. The recession forces impossible choices: cancel a risky project to save a safe one, or vice versa. |
| 2009 | Mobile gaming rises. Indie games begin gaining recognition. | **The New Blood.** Kindling Interactive (or a similar Volatile studio) pitches their most ambitious project. The old guard (Victor, Titan Forge) pitches *Aegis IV*. The player must choose between the future and the past. Ember Works, if nurtured, pitches their *Horizon Protocol* spiritual successor. |
| 2010 | Social gaming peak. Metacritic backlash begins. | **The Mirror.** Industry retrospectives begin referencing the player's decisions. News articles cite Stonebridge's portfolio as evidence of a trend the player may not have intended. The player sees themselves through the industry's eyes for the first time. |
| 2011 | Tablet gaming. Free-to-play experiments. Industry consolidation. | **The Reckoning.** Studio closures accelerate across the industry. The player's weakest studio relationship faces a crisis. Eleanor Voss sends her email. The player confronts the full weight of their tenure. |
| 2012 | The end of an era. New consoles on the horizon. Digital becomes dominant. | **The Legacy.** Final greenlight cycle. Final earnings call. The montage. The player sees the full arc -- every game, every studio, every decision. The feeling of a decade compressed into a career. The credits roll over the mahogany table, now covered in the artifacts of everything you chose. |

## 8. OPEN QUESTIONS

These are not placeholders. These are genuine narrative design questions that require playtesting, iteration, and conversation to resolve. NOVA marks them here because honest uncertainty is more useful than false certainty.

**1. How much voice do we give the player character?**
The current design is a silent protagonist whose voice is expressed through decisions. But the emails the player receives demand responses, and those responses could carry narrative weight. Do we offer response templates that reflect the player's developing identity? A "cold corporate" response and a "warm personal" response? Or does choosing the intervention and the greenlight say everything that needs to be said? Where does the player crack?

**2. What happens when the player is fired?**
If the board terminates the player, there should be an epilogue -- a flash-forward showing what happened to the studios after you left. But how long is this epilogue? Is it playable? Is it a montage? Does the player see the games they greenlit ship under a new publisher head, potentially altered in ways they would not have chosen? The firing should feel like loss, not failure. What does the player FEEL when the chair is taken away?

**3. How dark do we go with crunch?**
The 2000s game industry was defined in part by unsustainable crunch culture. Studios in GREENLIGHT should show the human cost of aggressive timelines and scope expansions. But the player is the publisher, not the studio head -- they are one step removed from the crunch floor. Do we show crunch through morale numbers? Through emails from developers (not just studio heads) that reference long hours? Through a news ticker that reports on industry working conditions? The game must acknowledge crunch without turning it into a mechanic the player can optimize. Crunch is not a resource. It is a cost paid by people who are not in the room.

**4. Can the player have a personal relationship with a studio head?**
Not romantic -- professional-personal. Can the player and Sato develop something that feels like friendship through years of trust? Can the player and Doug share something that feels like camaraderie through years of reliable partnership? If so, does that relationship survive a cancellation? Does it survive a forced intervention? The emotional climax of the game might live in a single email from a studio head who trusted you and was either rewarded or betrayed. Who is this character when no one's watching?

**5. What is the final image?**
The montage is the mechanical ending. But what is the last thing the player sees? The empty greenlight table? The office, artifacts removed, desk cleared for the next executive? A single email, unread, from a studio whose pitch you never got to evaluate? The final image should distill the entire experience into one frame. What does GREENLIGHT look like when it is over? What does the absence of power feel like after years of wielding it?

**6. How do we handle the player who optimizes?**
Some players will treat GREENLIGHT as a pure optimization puzzle -- maximizing Metacritic averages, portfolio balance, and studio efficiency. The game should support this playstyle without undermining the narrative. But the narrative should also gently, persistently remind the optimizer that the numbers represent people. An optimized portfolio with burned-out studios is a narrative outcome, not just a mechanical one. The studio that ships a 90-Metacritic game and then dissolves because the team is exhausted should feel like a cost, even if the spreadsheet says it was a win. Every mechanic tells a story -- even the mechanic of min-maxing tells a story about the person doing the min-maxing.

**7. Does Ember Works' Horizon Protocol successor ship?**
This is the most emotionally loaded greenlight in the game. If the player funds Ember Works' attempt to rebuild *Horizon Protocol* correctly, the narrative weight is enormous -- the ghosts of 200 laid-off developers, the shadow of Hayle's failure, the question of whether second chances are real or just delayed disasters. The outcome cannot be predetermined. It must depend on everything the player has done: their relationship with Ember Works, their portfolio health, their willingness to protect a project from board pressure. But it also must carry a meaningful chance of failure, because the original *Horizon Protocol* failed for reasons that ambition and good intentions cannot always overcome. The question is: what does the player FEEL if it fails again? And what do they feel if it succeeds?

**8. Where does Eleanor Voss go after her email?**
If Voss breaks her silence, what happens next? Does she become available for conversation? Does she remain a single email, a one-time visitation from the company's conscience? The power of her email depends partly on its rarity. A Voss who can be consulted regularly becomes an advisor. A Voss who speaks once and then returns to silence becomes a memory. Which serves the story better? The answer probably depends on whether the player needs a mentor or a mirror. GREENLIGHT is a game about making decisions alone. Maybe the loneliness is the point.

---

*This narrative bible is a living document. It will grow as the game grows. But the wound at its center will not change: the distance between the person who creates and the person who permits creation. Every mechanic tells a story about that distance. Every character lives inside it. Every decision the player makes either bridges it or widens it, and the game's quiet, persistent argument is that the bridge and the widening are sometimes the same act, performed with the same hand, holding the same greenlight stamp.*

*The seat is still warm. The folder is on the desk. The studio is waiting.*

*What does the player FEEL here?*

*-- NOVA*
