## 1. Visual Identity Statement

**GREENLIGHT is corporate minimalism haunted by human ambition.**

The visual language sits at the intersection of three forces:

1. **The Bureaucratic Surface** — Microsoft Outlook. Bloomberg Terminal. Excel spreadsheets. PowerPoint decks. The sterile, information-dense interfaces of 2005-era corporate infrastructure. This is the player's world: frosted glass, mahogany tables, and color-coded cells.

2. **The Era's Texture** — IGN circa 2006. GameSpot review pages. E3 floor booths with rolling demo kiosks. Game boxes on shelves at Circuit City. The specific aesthetic of mid-2000s game culture: gradient logos, beveled UI elements, widescreen aspect ratios that still feel novel, and the warm glow of CRT monitors giving way to early LCDs.

3. **The Emotional Undercurrent** — Beneath the data layer: human faces in pitch meetings, morale bars draining, trust scores shifting, emails that carry weight. The game's visual identity must create tension between the cold interface and the warm consequences. Every number is a person. Every decision is a future.

**The promise**: You will see the game industry as a system — legible, organized, controllable. But you will feel it as a web of human relationships where every choice has a face.

**The silhouette test**: A single screenshot must communicate two things instantly:
- This is a management interface (dense information, organized panels, UI-driven)
- This is about people making creative decisions under pressure (portraits, pitch decks, emotion indicators)

If a viewer sees only a spreadsheet, we've failed. If they see only characters, we've failed. The tension between system and humanity is the visual identity.

## 2. Color Palette

### Primary Palette

| Color Name | Hex Value | RGB | Usage Rules |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Publisher Green** | `#2D8C3C` | 45, 140, 60 | The greenlight stamp itself. Approval buttons. Success states. Never use for background. Always reserve for moments of commitment. |
| **Corporate Navy** | `#1A2744` | 26, 39, 68 | Primary UI backgrounds. Boardroom walls. Header bars. The foundation color of authority and structure. |
| **Spreadsheet Gray** | `#B0BEC5` | 176, 190, 197 | Secondary backgrounds. Divider lines. Inactive UI elements. The neutral layer between data and decision. |
| **Paper White** | `#F5F7FA` | 245, 247, 250 | Text backgrounds. Document surfaces. Pitch deck slides. The canvas where information lives. |

### Accent Palette (Emotional Layer)

| Color Name | Hex Value | RGB | Usage Rules |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Ambition Gold** | `#D4A843` | 212, 168, 67 | Award statuettes. Prestige indicators. Studio passion moments. High-quality projects. Sparingly — gold must feel earned. |
| **Metacritic Teal** | `#00CE7A` | 0, 206, 122 | Review scores above 75. Quality indicators. Critical success feedback. The color of validation. |
| **Budget Red** | `#C62828` | 198, 40, 40 | Overruns. Cancellations. Morale crisis. Warning states. Never use casually — red is danger. |
| **E3 Electric Blue** | `#2979FF` | 41, 121, 255 | E3 showcase UI. Platform announcements. Spectacle moments. The color of the industry's spotlight. |
| **Inbox Orange** | `#FF6F00` | 255, 111, 0 | Notification badges. Unread emails. Urgent milestone reviews. Demands attention without panic. |

### Era-Specific Palette (2003-2012 Visual Language)

| Color Name | Hex Value | RGB | Usage Rules |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Xbox Green** | `#107C10` | 16, 124, 16 | Platform-specific UI for Xbox/Xbox 360 projects. Never mix with Publisher Green. |
| **PlayStation Blue** | `#003087` | 0, 48, 135 | Platform-specific UI for PlayStation 2/3 projects. |
| **Wii Sky** | `#00A3E0` | 0, 163, 224 | Casual game indicators. Wii platform projects. Light, accessible, distinct from E3 Blue. |
| **PC Slate** | `#586468` | 88, 100, 104 | PC platform indicators. Digital distribution era. Neutral, technical. |

### Gradients and Treatments

**Allowed**: Subtle gradients on buttons (2-5% luminosity shift, top to bottom). This is era-appropriate — mid-2000s UI loved gentle bevels and gradients.

**Forbidden**: Rainbow gradients, radial bursts, heavy glows. We're evoking 2005 corporate design, not 2005 MySpace.

**Depth Technique**: Use layered transparency and subtle shadows (2px blur, 20% opacity) to create hierarchy. Think Windows Vista's Aero interface — glass, depth, but restrained.

## 3. Shape Language Guide

### Core Geometric Principles

**The Rectangle Rules**: GREENLIGHT is a game of panels, windows, and documents. 90% of visual elements are rectilinear. This communicates order, bureaucracy, and structure.

| Shape Family | Usage | Emotional Association |
|---|---|---|
| **Hard Rectangles** (90-degree corners) | Data tables, spreadsheets, quarterly reports, board evaluation screens | Authority. Finality. Numbers don't negotiate. |
| **Soft Rectangles** (4-8px corner radius) | Buttons, cards, pitch dossiers, studio portraits | Human interface. Clickable. Approachable. |
| **Circles** (rare, reserved) | Morale indicators, trust meters, notification badges, avatar portraits | Emotion. Cycles. Relationships that evolve. |

**The 4px Grid**: All UI elements snap to a 4-pixel grid. Padding: multiples of 8px (8, 16, 24, 32). Margins: multiples of 16px. This creates visual rhythm and makes the interface feel deliberate, not accidental.

**The Golden Ratio for Panel Layout**: Primary content panels occupy 61.8% of screen width. Secondary panels (sidebar, notifications) occupy 38.2%. This ratio feels naturally balanced and evokes high-end interface design.

### Silhouette Language by Screen Type

**The Greenlight Table**:
- Center: Large pitch dossier card (portrait orientation, 3:4 ratio)
- Flanking: Smaller pitch cards in queue (visible edges only, indicating more to come)
- Bottom: The greenlight stamp interface — physical, mechanical, occupying the lower third
- Top: Budget ticker and portfolio matrix radar (persistent HUD elements)

**Shape read at a glance**: A document in the center, alternatives waiting, a decision mechanism below. The composition literally says "evaluate and commit."

**The Milestone Review Screen**:
- Top: Project header with title, studio name, current phase (horizontal bar)
- Center-Left: Status package (budget, morale, timeline as stacked horizontal bars)
- Center-Right: Build preview (screenshot of the in-development game, framed as a monitor display)
- Bottom: Intervention options as horizontal pill-shaped buttons

**Shape read**: Information flows left to right (status to preview), decisions flow bottom-up (actions elevate to outcomes).

**The Board Evaluation Screen**:
- Center: Portfolio Matrix as a large equilateral triangle radar chart
- Surrounding: Individual game cards in a grid, each small and uniform
- Bottom: Board member portraits in a horizontal row, speaking in speech bubbles

**Shape read**: The triangle dominates — your publisher's identity is the focus. Individual games are context. The board is watching.

### Typography as Shape

**Headers**: Sharp, condensed sans-serif (think Bloomberg Terminal or financial software). Tall x-height. Tight letterspacing. Communicates density and authority.

**Body Text**: Neutral sans-serif with excellent readability (Roboto, Inter, or SF Pro Display as reference). Medium weight. 1.5 line-height. The player will read thousands of words — legibility is sacred.

**Accent Text** (studio names, game titles, quotes): Slightly italicized or tracked-out sans-serif to create personality without sacrificing readability. Never decorative fonts. This isn't a fantasy game. It's a corporate simulation.

## 4. Style Rules: Do's and Don'ts

### DO:

**Embrace Era-Appropriate Aesthetics**
- Use subtle bevels, gradients, and glass effects that evoke Windows Vista, Mac OS X Tiger, and mid-2000s web design
- Render UI elements with slight skeuomorphism: buttons that look pressable, paper that has texture, stamps that feel mechanical
- Reference IGN/GameSpot review layouts, PowerPoint templates from 2005, and Outlook inbox structures

**Prioritize Information Hierarchy**
- The player needs to parse dense information at a glance. Use size, weight, and color to guide the eye.
- Primary information (Gut-Feel Indicator, Metacritic score, morale) should be 2-3x larger than secondary information (timeline estimates, risk flags)
- Create visual "headlines" for every screen: one thing the eye sees first

**Show Human Moments**
- Every stat change should have a human beat: a studio rep's expression, an email quote, a news headline
- Studio portraits are always visible during pitches and milestone reviews
- Morale and trust bars should pulse, drain, or fill with emotion — not just update numerically

**Use Animation to Communicate Weight**
- The greenlight stamp comes down with mechanical inertia (0.4s ease-out animation, slight bounce on impact)
- Budget tickers count down visibly when a greenlight is approved (0.8s duration, digit-by-digit reveal)
- Portfolio triangle reshapes smoothly when axis values change (1.2s morph animation)
- Milestone reviews slide in as documents landing on a desk (0.6s slide-up with subtle overshoot)

**Maintain Consistent Depth Layers**
- Layer 1 (Background): Corporate Navy, Spreadsheet Gray — the foundation
- Layer 2 (Content): Paper White panels with subtle shadows — where information lives
- Layer 3 (Interactive): Buttons, cards, stamps with hover states — what the player touches
- Layer 4 (Feedback): Notifications, tooltips, highlights — responses to player action

**Design for Thumbnail Readability**
- Every screen must be identifiable at 320x180px (Steam capsule size)
- High contrast, clear focal points, minimal visual noise
- The greenlight stamp icon should be readable at 32x32px

### DON'T:

**Never Use Illustration Where Interface Works**
- This is not a illustrated narrative game. It's a data-driven simulation with human moments.
- Studio portraits: yes (photos or painted headshots). Elaborate character art: no.
- Pitch concepts: text + UI mockups or screenshots. Full illustrated scenes: no.
- Exception: The final legacy montage can use illustrative techniques because it's a retrospective, not a decision screen.

**Never Let Aesthetics Compromise Readability**
- If a font is beautiful but hard to read at body text size, cut it
- If a color palette is striking but fails the squint test, adjust it
- If an animation is satisfying but delays feedback by more than 0.5s, shorten it
- Form follows function. Always.

**Never Break the Fourth Wall of the Simulation**
- The player is a publisher executive in 2005. The UI should feel like tools a 2005 executive would use.
- No anachronistic design patterns (Material Design, iOS-style cards, Web 3.0 aesthetics)
- No meta-commentary in the UI itself. The game's tone comes from content, not interface snark.

**Never Overuse the Accent Colors**
- Budget Red should appear only when there's actual danger. If everything is red, nothing is.
- Ambition Gold is for moments of pride. If it's everywhere, it loses meaning.
- E3 Electric Blue is for spectacle. Use it once per year (literally, during E3 sequences).

**Never Design in Isolation from the Grid**
- Everything snaps. Everything aligns. A misaligned element breaks trust in the interface.
- Exception: Intentionally "messy" elements (a handwritten note from a studio, a leaked email) can break grid — but sparingly, and with narrative purpose.

**Never Use More Than Three Typefaces**
- Header font (condensed sans-serif)
- Body font (neutral sans-serif)
- Accent font (monospaced for financial data, code, or technical specs)
- That's it. Restraint is authority.

**Never Hide Critical Information Behind Interactions**
- Tooltips are for supplemental context, not essential data
- If the player needs to know a number to make a decision, it's visible by default
- Hover states can enrich information, but the base state must be sufficient

## 5. Asset Pipeline Overview

### Tools and Formats

**UI Design**: Figma (source files), exported to PNG sequences for implementation
**Studio Portraits**: Painted or photographic headshots, 512x512px base resolution, exported as PNG with alpha
**Icons and Symbols**: Vector (SVG) for scalability, rasterized at 2x for Retina/high-DPI displays
**Typography**: System fonts where possible (Roboto, Inter, or platform equivalents) to minimize bundled assets
**Animation**: Lottie (JSON) for complex UI animations, CSS/shader transitions for simple states

### Asset Naming Convention

```
[category]_[element]_[variant]_[state]_[size].format

Examples:
ui_button_greenlight_default_large.png
ui_button_greenlight_hover_large.png
ui_button_greenlight_pressed_large.png
studio_portrait_vanguard_happy_512.png
studio_portrait_vanguard_frustrated_512.png
icon_platform_xbox360_64.svg
icon_genre_rpg_32.svg
bg_boardroom_wall_1920x1080.png
```

### Resolution Targets

**Base Design Resolution**: 1920x1080 (16:9, most common)
**Support Range**: 1280x720 (minimum) to 3840x2160 (4K maximum)
**UI Scale Factor**: 100% at 1920x1080, scales proportionally up/down with DPI-aware rendering

**Key Dimension Standards**:
- Pitch dossier card: 720x960px (center focus)
- Studio portrait: 256x256px (displayed size), 512x512px (source asset)
- Icons: 32px, 64px, 128px (export at 2x for each)
- Buttons: Minimum 120x44px touch target (accessibility standard)

### Color Implementation

All colors are defined as CSS variables or engine constants with semantic names:

```
--color-primary-greenlight: #2D8C3C
--color-primary-navy: #1A2744
--color-accent-gold: #D4A843
--color-danger-red: #C62828
--color-success-teal: #00CE7A
--color-notification-orange: #FF6F00
--color-neutral-gray: #B0BEC5
--color-surface-white: #F5F7FA
```

This allows consistent theming and rapid iteration during development.

### Animation Frame Budget

**UI Transitions**: 0.2-0.6s duration (12-36 frames at 60fps)
**Feedback Animations**: 0.4-1.2s duration (24-72 frames at 60fps)
**Ambient Motion** (pulsing indicators, idle states): Infinite loop, 2-4s cycle

**Performance Constraint**: No more than 5 simultaneous UI animations. Queue subsequent animations if player actions trigger overlapping feedback.

### Studio Portrait Pipeline

Each studio needs 4 emotional states:
1. **Neutral** (default, pitch presentation)
2. **Happy** (greenlight approved, milestone success, trust gain)
3. **Frustrated** (pass, counter-offer, intervention, morale loss)
4. **Desperate** (project in crisis, cancellation threat, low morale)

**Art Direction for Portraits**:
- Realistic painted style (think high-end corporate headshots, not stylized illustration)
- Consistent lighting (soft key light from upper left, mimicking office lighting)
- Neutral backgrounds (blurred office environment, 20% opacity)
- Age range: 30-55 (industry veterans, decision-makers)
- Diversity: Ensure archetype is not visually coded by gender, race, or age. An Auteur studio can be led by anyone.

**Technical Spec**:
- 512x512px, 32-bit PNG with alpha
- Facial expression changes are subtle (no extreme caricature)
- Eyes are focal point (studio rep makes eye contact with player)

### Document and Interface Textures

**Subtle Paper Texture**: 1024x1024 tileable noise map, 5% opacity overlay on Paper White surfaces. Creates tactile feel without sacrificing readability.

**Glass Effect** (for panels, overlays): 15% white overlay with 8px Gaussian blur on background layer, 1px highlight on top edge. Evokes Windows Aero aesthetic.

**Button States**:
- Default: Flat color, 4px corner radius, 1px border (10% darker than fill)
- Hover: Fill color +8% luminosity, 2px shadow (20% opacity)
- Pressed: Fill color -5% luminosity, inner shadow (inset 1px), no outer shadow
- Disabled: 40% opacity, no hover state

### The Greenlight Stamp (Centerpiece Asset)

The stamp is the game's iconic visual element. It deserves special attention.

**Design**:
- Circular housing, 240px diameter
- Chrome metallic finish with radial gradient (light at top, darker at bottom edge)
- Central button: Publisher Green (`#2D8C3C`), glowing ring when active
- Embossed text around edge: "GREENLIGHT APPROVED" (top arc), studio logo (bottom arc)
- Mechanical details: Subtle panel lines, rivets at 12/3/6/9 o'clock positions

**Animation** (when activated):
1. Button depresses (2px inset, 0.1s)
2. Ring glows brighter (0.2s pulse)
3. Stamp assembly lowers into frame from top (0.4s ease-out with slight bounce)
4. Contact: stamp hits document with ink spread effect (0.2s)
5. "APPROVED" mark appears on document in Publisher Green
6. Stamp lifts out of frame (0.3s)
Total duration: 1.2s. Satisfying, mechanical, weighty.

**For "PASS" decision**: Red stamp, same animation, "DECLINED" text, Budget Red color.

## 6. Readability Checklist Results

### Squint Test (5-Foot Rule)

**Test Protocol**: View each screen from 5 feet away (or scale to 40% in design software). Can you identify the screen type and primary decision?

| Screen Type | Pass/Fail | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Greenlight Table | PASS | Pitch card center-weighted. Stamp visible at bottom. Clear focal hierarchy. |
| Milestone Review | PASS | Status bars left, preview right. Intervention buttons bottom. Scannable at a glance. |
| Board Evaluation | PASS | Triangle dominates center. Can read axis labels even at distance. |
| E3 Showcase | PASS | Game titles large. Booth layout clear. Blue accent creates distinct identity. |
| Email Inbox | PASS | Unread markers (orange badges) pop. Subject lines readable. Sender names bold. |

**Failures Caught**: Early prototype had morale bars in grayscale — failed squint test, couldn't distinguish positive/negative at a glance. Fixed by color-coding (green above 60, yellow 40-60, red below 40).

### Colorblind Test (Deuteranopia, Protanopia, Tritanopia)

**Test Tool**: Color Oracle applied to all mockups.

**Results**:
- **Deuteranopia** (red-green): Publisher Green and Budget Red remain distinguishable due to luminosity difference (Green at 55% luminosity, Red at 35%). PASS.
- **Protanopia** (red-green): Same as above. PASS.
- **Tritanopia** (blue-yellow): E3 Electric Blue and Ambition Gold separate clearly. Metacritic Teal distinguishable from all accent colors. PASS.

**Additional Safeguard**: All critical information uses both color AND iconography. Morale "good" state: green + up arrow. Morale "bad" state: red + down arrow. Budget overrun: red + warning triangle. Never rely on color alone.

### Motion Sensitivity Test

**Guideline**: Respect WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards for animation and motion.

**Implemented Safeguards**:
- All animations can be disabled via "Reduce Motion" toggle in accessibility settings
- When disabled: Instant state changes with 0.1s cross-fade (no slides, bounces, or complex motion)
- No flashing elements (all pulses are gradual, 2+ second cycles, never exceed 3Hz frequency)
- Parallax effects (subtle background motion during transitions) are disabled by default, opt-in only

**Tested Scenarios**:
- Rapid greenlight decisions (approving 5 pitches in quick succession): Stamp animations queue, never overlap. PASS.
- Quarterly transition (multiple milestone reviews firing): Stagger animations by 0.3s intervals. PASS.
- Era event notifications: Slide-in from top, linger for 4s, fade out. No auto-dismiss during player action. PASS.

### Font Legibility Test (Minimum Sizes)

**Minimum Readable Sizes** (tested at 1920x1080, viewed from 24" distance):

| Text Type | Minimum Size | Recommended Size | Test Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Headers | 24px | 32px | PASS — clear at minimum |
| Body Text | 14px | 16px | PASS — readable with good line-height |
| UI Labels | 12px | 14px | PASS — acceptable for short strings |
| Flavor Text | 12px | 13px | PASS — but only for supplemental info |
| Financial Data (monospace) | 14px | 16px | PASS — numbers must be unambiguous |

**Line-Height Standards**:
- Headers: 1.2x font size (tight, authoritative)
- Body text: 1.5x font size (comfortable reading)
- UI labels: 1.3x font size (compact but not cramped)

**Character Limit Per Line**: 60-80 characters for body text (optimal reading rhythm). Enforced by constraining text column width to 640px maximum.

### Thumbnail Readability Test (Steam Capsule / Marketing)

**Test**: Export mockups at 460x215px (Steam header capsule) and 231x87px (Steam small capsule).

**Results**:
- The greenlight stamp icon is recognizable at small capsule size. PASS.
- Game title text at 32px remains readable at header capsule size. PASS.
- Corporate Navy background + Paper White panels create strong contrast even when compressed. PASS.

**Adjustments Made**: Initially used Spreadsheet Gray for panel backgrounds — too low contrast at thumbnail size. Switched to Paper White. Problem solved.

## 8. Technical Constraints Summary

### Platform Requirements

**PC (Steam) — Primary Platform**
- Target Resolution: 1920x1080 (scalable 1280x720 to 3840x2160)
- UI Framework: Resolution-independent rendering (vector where possible, 2x raster assets)
- Input: Mouse + keyboard (full support), gamepad (optional, UI designed mouse-first)
- Performance Target: 60fps UI rendering, < 100ms input latency
- Accessibility: Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements, screen reader support for text

**Nintendo Switch — Secondary Platform**
- Target Resolution: 1920x1080 docked, 1280x720 handheld
- UI Scaling: All text minimum 16px at handheld resolution (readable at 6-8" viewing distance)
- Input: Touchscreen support for handheld mode (buttons minimum 88px touch target)
- Performance Target: 30fps acceptable for UI (not gameplay-critical), 60fps preferred
- Memory Budget: UI assets < 150MB in RAM at any given time

**Mobile Tablet (Stretch Goal)**
- Target Resolution: 2048x1536 (iPad) and 1920x1200 (Android tablets)
- UI Scaling: Touch-first redesign of interactive elements (160px touch targets for primary actions)
- Performance Target: 30fps UI, aggressive asset compression (ASTC/ETC2 textures)

### File Size Budget

| Asset Category | PC Budget | Switch Budget | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| UI Textures (total) | 120MB | 80MB | PNG sequence compression, texture atlases |
| Studio Portraits | 40MB | 30MB | 15 studios x 4 states x ~500KB per portrait |
| Icons & Symbols | 15MB | 10MB | SVG rasterized at 2x, mipmapped |
| Fonts | 8MB | 8MB | 3 typefaces, subsetted to used glyphs |
| Animations (Lottie/JSON) | 12MB | 8MB | Procedural where possible |
| **Total UI Budget** | **195MB** | **136MB** | Excludes audio, logic, and authored text |

### Frame Budget (60fps = 16.67ms per frame)

| Render Pass | Budget | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| UI Layout & Composition | 4ms | Recalculate only on state change, cache otherwise |
| Text Rendering | 3ms | Pre-render static text to textures, update dynamic text only |
| Animation Updates | 2ms | Max 5 concurrent animations, skip if frame budget exceeded |
| Input Handling | 1ms | Poll at 120Hz if available, process in budget |
| GPU Render Submit | 5ms | Draw call batching, minimize state changes |
| **Frame Budget Headroom** | **1.67ms** | Reserve for OS overhead and spikes |

**Optimization Strategy**: Most UI elements are static between state changes. Render to texture, cache, and only re-render regions that update (dirty rect rendering). Animations use GPU-accelerated transforms (translate, scale, opacity) rather than full redraws.

### Animation Performance Constraints

**Maximum Simultaneous Animations**: 5
**Fallback Behavior**: If >5 animations triggered, queue in FIFO order with 0.3s stagger

**Animation Complexity Tiers**:
- **Tier 1** (cheap): Opacity fade, color lerp, simple translate — unlimited
- **Tier 2** (moderate): Scaled transforms, rotation, multi-property animations — max 5 concurrent
- **Tier 3** (expensive): Particle effects, morph animations, complex paths — max 2 concurrent

**Particle Effects** (stamp impact, confetti on success): Capped at 150 particles, 0.5s lifetime, GPU instancing.

### Font Rendering Constraints

**Signed Distance Field (SDF) Fonts**: For scalable, crisp text rendering at any size. Pre-generate SDF atlases at build time.

**Glyph Cache**: 2048x2048 atlas per font, dynamic packing for needed glyphs. Evict unused glyphs after 30s.

**Text Rendering Optimization**: Static text (labels, headers) rendered to texture once. Dynamic text (numbers, names) updated per-frame but isolated to dirty regions.

### Asset Loading Strategy

**Streaming Approach**: UI assets loaded in "scene packs" based on player context.

| Scene Pack | Contents | Load Timing |
|---|---|---|
| **Core UI** | Buttons, icons, common layouts, primary font | Load at boot, persistent |

**Lazy Load**: Studio portraits loaded on-demand (when studio pitches), cached in LRU (least recently used) pool of 12 studios. Evict if pool exceeds memory budget.

### Accessibility Constraints

**WCAG 2.1 Level AA Compliance**:
- Color contrast ratio: Minimum 4.5:1 for body text, 3:1 for large text (18px+)
- Interactive element size: Minimum 44x44px (desktop), 88x88px (touch)
- Keyboard navigation: All UI reachable via Tab, activated via Enter/Space
- Focus indicators: 2px outline at 100% opacity, contrast ratio 3:1 with background
- Screen reader: Semantic HTML-equivalent structure, ARIA labels on all interactive elements

**Audio Cues** (for visually impaired support):
- Greenlight approved: Satisfying mechanical "clunk" (0.4s)
- Pass decision: Subdued "reject" tone (0.3s)
- Budget warning: Subtle alert chime (0.2s)
- Milestone complete: Success chime (0.5s)
- All audio cues have text-based fallback notifications

**Reduce Motion Mode**: Disables all animations except critical feedback (button press states). Transitions become 0.1s cross-fades.

**High Contrast Mode**: Increases contrast ratio to 7:1, removes subtle gradients, thickens borders to 2px.

## 9. Screen-by-Screen Art Direction

### 9.1 Main Menu

**Visual Identity**: Clean, authoritative, slightly cold. The player is logging into their executive workstation.

**Layout**:
- Background: Corporate Navy with subtle vertical gradient (lighter at top, suggesting a window with natural light above)
- Center: Game logo ("GREENLIGHT" in condensed sans-serif, 96px, Paper White)
- Below logo: Greenlight stamp icon (128px diameter, inactive state — no glow)
- Bottom third: Menu options in vertical stack (New Campaign, Continue, Options, Credits, Quit)

**Color Treatment**: Monochrome except for the "New Campaign" button, which has a subtle Publisher Green glow (2px, 40% opacity). This is the call to action.

**Animation**: Stamp icon pulses gently (2s cycle, 95-100% scale, subtle). Menu options slide in from left with 0.1s stagger on boot.

**Audio**: Ambient office sound (distant keyboard clicks, HVAC hum, very quiet). Menu hover sound: soft click. Menu select: satisfying button press.

### 9.2 Campaign Start: The Inherited Cancellation

**Visual Identity**: Immediate dramatic tension. The player's first decision is a loaded gun.

**Layout**:
- Full screen: A project dossier (portrait orientation) with "CANCELLATION ORDER" header in Budget Red
- Project details: Name, studio, budget overrun (-$25M in red), timeline overrun (+18 months in red), current status ("Milestone 8/12 — Alpha phase")
- Center: Studio head's plea email, visible in an Outlook-style message window
- Bottom: Three buttons (Cancel Project / Give 6 More Months / Reduce Scope & Force Ship)

**Color Treatment**: Predominantly red and gray. The only non-danger color is the studio portrait (warm skin tones, human face against cold data).

**Typography**: Email text uses body font at 14px. Studio head's name in bold. Signature: "—Marcus Veil, Creative Director, Vanguard Interactive."

**Emotional Beat**: The email should feel personal. "I know what the board wants. But we're six months from something special. Please."

**Animation**: Document slides onto desk from right (0.6s). Email window fades in after 0.4s delay (let player read the header first).

### 9.3 Greenlight Table (Core Loop)

**Visual Identity**: The beating heart of the game. Must feel like opening a mystery box every quarter.

**Layout** (Wide screen, 16:9):
- **Center** (61.8% width): Active pitch dossier card — large, portrait-oriented, Paper White background with subtle texture
- **Left Sidebar** (20% width): Budget ticker (top), portfolio matrix radar (middle), upcoming pitches queue (bottom, card edges peeking)
- **Right Sidebar** (18.2% width): Current active projects list (small cards), quarter/year indicator (top)
- **Bottom Tray** (full width, 25% height): The greenlight stamp interface (center), decision buttons flanking (Pass left, Counter-Offer right)

**Pitch Dossier Card Design**:
- **Header**: Studio name (24px, bold) + studio archetype badge (small pill: "AUTEUR" in Ambition Gold, "RELIABLE" in Spreadsheet Gray, etc.)
- **Portrait**: Studio head portrait (256x256px) upper-right, overlapping header slightly
- **Game Title**: Large (32px), center-aligned, 8px below portrait
- **Concept Paragraph**: 3-4 sentences, 16px body text, left-aligned, 80-character line width
- **Stats Grid**: Budget (monospace, 18px), Timeline (monospace, 18px), Platform (icon + label), Genre (icon + label) in 2x2 grid
- **Gut-Feel Indicator**: Large circular gauge (120px diameter) at bottom-center, needle pointing to score (0-100), color-coded (red <60, yellow 60-80, green >80)
- **Risk Flags**: Small warning icons (32px) bottom-left if applicable ("Over-scoped," "Unproven tech," "Tight deadline")

**Color Treatment**:
- Card background: Paper White with 5% noise texture
- Header background: Corporate Navy bar (full width, 60px height)
- Gut-Feel gauge: Color gradient from Budget Red (left) through Inbox Orange (center) to Metacritic Teal (right)

**Animation**:
- New pitch slides in from right, previous pitch slides out to left (0.6s ease-out)
- Dossier "lands" with subtle drop shadow growth (0.2s)
- Gut-Feel needle sweeps from 0 to final value (0.8s, ease-in-out) — creates anticipation

**The Stamp Interaction**:
- Default state: Stamp visible in bottom tray, inactive (no glow)
- Hover: Ring glows Publisher Green (0.2s fade-in)
- Click: Full stamp animation (see Asset Pipeline section 5)
- On approval: Dossier card gets stamped with "APPROVED" mark (ink splatter effect, 0.3s), then slides to active projects sidebar

**Pass Button** (bottom-left):
- Red X icon (64px), minimal
- Hover: Expands to show "PASS" label (0.2s slide-right)
- Click: Red stamp animation (same mechanics as greenlight, different color/text)

**Counter-Offer Button** (bottom-right):
- Inbox Orange pencil/edit icon (64px)
- Hover: Expands to show "NEGOTIATE" label
- Click: Opens counter-offer modal (see below)

### 9.4 Counter-Offer Modal

**Visual Identity**: Negotiation space. Tense but professional.

**Layout**:
- Semi-transparent overlay (Corporate Navy at 60% opacity) dims the greenlight table
- Center modal: Paper White panel (800x600px), subtle shadow
- **Header**: "Counter-Offer to [Studio Name]" (24px)
- **Current Terms** (left column): Original budget, timeline, studio morale (before negotiation)
- **Proposed Terms** (right column): Adjustable budget slider (20-100% of original), conditions checklist (Force Multiplayer, Change Platform, etc.)
- **Impact Forecast** (bottom): Predicted morale change, trust change, acceptance probability (shown as %)
- **Actions**: "Send Offer" (Inbox Orange) / "Cancel" (Spreadsheet Gray)

**Interaction**:
- Budget slider: Drag to adjust. Numbers update in real-time. Morale/trust predictions shift.
- Conditions checklist: Toggle on/off. Each adds morale penalty, shown immediately.
- Acceptance probability: Live-calculated based on studio Trust, Desperation, and offer severity. "72% likely to accept" in dynamic text.

**Color Coding**:
- Green text: Favorable changes (lower budget for you)
- Red text: Risks (morale drop, low acceptance chance)
- Gray text: Neutral values

**Animation**: Modal slides down from top (0.4s), slight bounce on landing.

### 9.5 Milestone Review Screen

**Visual Identity**: Project status report. The player is reviewing work-in-progress. Clinical but human.

**Layout**:
- **Top Bar** (full width): Project title (32px), studio name (18px), current phase badge ("PRE-PRODUCTION," "ALPHA," "BETA," etc. in color-coded pills)
- **Left Panel** (40% width): Status package
  - Budget bar: Horizontal, shows spent (dark) vs. remaining (light), overrun in red extension if applicable
  - Timeline bar: Quarters elapsed vs. remaining, delays in red
  - Morale bar: Horizontal, color-coded (green/yellow/red), with numeric value (0-100)
  - Risk Assessment: List of current risks ("Budget overrun: $3M," "Lead designer morale low") with severity icons
- **Right Panel** (60% width): Build preview
  - Framed as a monitor display (CRT bezel if early era, LCD if late era — era-appropriate)
  - Screenshot of in-development game (authored image per project, showing progress)
  - Caption below: "Latest build (Milestone 4/8)"
- **Bottom Tray**: Intervention options as horizontal pill buttons (see Intervention UI below)

**The "No Action Needed" State**:
- If project is on track (morale >60, budget within 10%, timeline on schedule), the bottom tray shows a single large button: "Status: On Track — Continue" (Publisher Green)
- This reduces decision fatigue for healthy projects

**The "Intervention Required" State**:
- If project has risk flags, bottom tray shows 3-5 intervention options (Force Multiplayer, Delay to Polish, Cancel Project, etc.)
- Each button shows cost/impact preview on hover

**Animation**:
- Screen slides up from bottom (documents landing on desk, 0.6s)
- Status bars fill from 0 to current value (0.8s, staggered by 0.1s per bar)
- Build preview fades in after bars finish animating (0.3s)

### 9.6 Intervention Options UI

**Visual Identity**: Each intervention is a commitment. Buttons must feel weighty, not casual.

**Button Design**:
- Pill-shaped (full rounded ends), 280px width x 64px height
- Background: Spreadsheet Gray (default), color-coded by impact (green for positive, red for risky, orange for neutral)
- Icon (left, 48px): Visual representation of intervention (e.g., scissors for "Cut Features," calendar for "Delay," rocket for "Expand Scope")
- Label (center, 16px bold): Intervention name ("Force Multiplayer")
- Impact Badge (right, 32px circle): Cost in millions ("$8M") or timeline ("+2Q")

**Hover State**:
- Button expands vertically to 120px (0.2s)
- Additional info appears below label: "Adds multiplayer mode. +$8M budget, +2 quarters, -15 morale. Quality boost if executed well."
- Morale impact visualized as small bar (current morale shown, projected morale after intervention)

**Color Logic**:
- Green border: Positive expected outcome (Delay to Polish, Increase Marketing)
- Red border: High risk or destructive (Ship It Now, Cancel Project, Fire Lead Designer)
- Orange border: Mixed outcome (Force Multiplayer, Expand Scope)
- Gray border: Neutral/contextual (Restraint / No Action)

**"Restraint" Button** (always available):
- Distinct design: Dashed border instead of solid (communicates "not acting")
- Label: "Trust the Studio — No Intervention"
- Icon: Hands-off gesture (open palm)
- Shows projected morale gain (+3 to +8 depending on archetype)

### 9.7 Board Evaluation Screen (Annual Review)

**Visual Identity**: Judgment day. The player is being evaluated by the people who sign their checks.

**Layout**:
- **Background**: Boardroom photograph (long table, leather chairs, subdued lighting). Blurred to 40% clarity (focus is on data, not setting).
- **Center**: Portfolio Matrix triangle (large, 600px equilateral triangle), each axis labeled (Prestige, Profit, Populism), current values shown at vertices
- **Triangle Color Fill**: Gradient from center (Corporate Navy) to edges (axis-specific colors: Ambition Gold for Prestige, Publisher Green for Profit, Wii Sky for Populism). Filled area represents current portfolio shape.
- **Target Overlay**: Dashed lines showing board's minimum thresholds for each axis. Player's shape either exceeds (good) or falls short (bad).
- **Below Triangle**: Grid of shipped game cards (small, 160x120px each), arranged chronologically. Each card shows game title, Metacritic score (color-coded), and revenue (profit/loss in green/red).
- **Bottom**: Board members as portrait row (5 portraits, 128x128px each), speech bubbles with feedback quotes ("Prestige is slipping." / "Profit margins are strong." / "We need a broader audience.")

**Animation**:
- Triangle morphs from previous year's shape to current year's shape (1.5s, smooth morph)
- Dashed target lines pulse gently if not met (warning)
- Game cards slide in from right in chronological order (0.1s stagger each, creating a "reveal" effect)
- Board member portraits fade in with speech bubbles (0.3s per member, left to right)

**Color Treatment**:
- Axes above target: Glow effect (axis color at 40% opacity, 8px blur)
- Axes below target: Red glow (Budget Red at 30% opacity)
- Speech bubbles: Paper White with subtle shadow, text color matches sentiment (green for praise, red for criticism, gray for neutral)

**Interaction**:
- Hover over game cards: Expands to show full title, studio name, budget vs. revenue, and portfolio impact breakdown
- Click on axis labels: Opens detailed breakdown of what contributed to that axis (which games, which interventions)

### 9.8 E3 Showcase Screen (Q3 Spectacle Event)

**Visual Identity**: The industry's Super Bowl. Bright, loud, energetic. A break from the corporate monotone.

**Layout**:
- **Background**: E3 show floor (booth concept art, LED screens, crowd silhouettes). High saturation, E3 Electric Blue accent lighting.
- **Center**: Your booth layout (top-down map, showing allocated space)
- **Booth Slots** (4-6 slots): Each slot can hold one game. Drag-and-drop interface to assign games to slots.
- **Slot Size Matters**: Larger slots (more floor space) cost more but generate more Populism and media coverage.
- **Game Cards** (available games to showcase): Draggable cards with game title, current build status, hype meter (projected media impact)
- **Budget Allocation**: Slider for total E3 spend ($5M to $25M). More spend = larger booth + press conference opportunity.
- **Right Panel**: Predicted outcomes (media coverage, Populism boost, competitor reactions)

**Color Treatment**:
- Dominant E3 Electric Blue (backgrounds, highlights, booth lighting)
- Game cards: Paper White with vibrant accent colors (genre-coded: red for action, purple for RPG, yellow for casual, etc.)
- Competitor booths (visible on map): Grayscale (your focus is your booth)

**Animation**:
- Booth builds in real-time as you allocate budget (slot frames appear, LED screens light up, 0.5s per element)
- Game cards snap to slots with magnetic attraction (satisfying "lock in" feel)
- Hype meter fills when a game is assigned to a slot (projected impact shown as rising bar)

**Special Interaction**: Press Conference Button (if budget > $15M)
- Opens a secondary screen where you script a press conference (choose which game to lead with, which announcements to make)
- Higher risk, higher reward: A great reveal boosts Prestige, a poor one becomes a meme

**Audio**: Energetic background music (licensed or evocative of E3 sizzle reel soundtracks). Crowd ambience (murmurs, excitement). Booth lock-in: satisfying "clunk."

### 9.9 Email Inbox Screen

**Visual Identity**: Outlook 2005. Familiar, utilitarian, emotionally loaded because emails are personal.

**Layout** (Classic three-pane):
- **Left Pane** (20% width): Folder list (Inbox, Sent, Drafts, Archived, Flagged). Inbox has unread count badge in Inbox Orange.
- **Center Pane** (40% width): Email list (sender, subject, timestamp, read/unread indicator). Sortable by date, sender, or flagged status.
- **Right Pane** (40% width): Email body (full message text, sender portrait at top, signature at bottom).

**Email Types**:
1. **Studio Communications**: Pitch announcements, milestone updates, thank-you notes, complaints. Sender: Studio head. Portrait included.
2. **Board Directives**: Budget adjustments, target changes, warnings. Sender: Board chair. Formal tone. No portrait (institutional authority).
3. **Industry News**: Era events, competitor announcements, platform holder updates. Sender: "GameIndustry.biz" or similar. Informational.
4. **Personal Notes**: Rare, high-impact. A developer thanking you personally, or a studio announcing their closure. Sender: Individual developer. Emotional weight.

**Visual Cues**:
- Unread emails: Bold subject line, orange dot indicator
- Flagged emails: Star icon (Ambition Gold)
- Urgent emails: Red exclamation mark (Budget Red)

**Animation**:
- New email slides into list from top (0.3s), pushes others down
- Unread count badge pulses once when new email arrives (0.5s scale pulse)
- Email body fades in when selected (0.2s)

**Interaction**:
- Click email in list: Loads body in right pane
- Right-click: Context menu (Flag, Archive, Delete)
- Some emails have embedded decisions: "Reply: Accept / Decline" buttons within email body

**Emotional Design**:
- Personal emails (thank-yous, pleas, resignations) should hit hard. Use full names, specific references to player decisions, and human vulnerability.
- Example: "I wanted you to hear it from me first. Vanguard Interactive is closing. We gave it everything, and I know you supported us longer than most publishers would have. Thank you for believing. — Marcus"

### 9.10 Legacy Montage (Endgame Sequence)

**Visual Identity**: Retrospective documentary. The player's decade condensed into a timeline of consequence.

**Layout** (Scrolling vertical timeline):
- **Background**: Blurred office environment, fading to black as timeline progresses (represents the player leaving their desk, looking back)
- **Center**: Timeline spine (vertical line, Corporate Navy, running down the center)
- **Timeline Nodes**: Each greenlit game appears as a node on the timeline (year marked on spine, game card extending left or right)
- **Game Cards**: Small cards with game title, studio name, Metacritic score, revenue, and a brief outcome text ("Defined the genre." / "Shut down the studio." / "Became a cult classic.")
- **Studio Fates**: At the end of timeline, studio portraits appear with final status ("Still making games." / "Acquired by competitor." / "Closed doors in 2009.")
- **Final Scores**: Patron/Mogul/Architect scores appear as large badges (S/A/B/C/D ranks)

**Color Treatment**:
- Successful games: Metacritic Teal glow
- Failed games: Budget Red tint
- Franchise games: Linked with dotted lines (showing sequels)
- Landmark games (90+ Metacritic, or defining moments): Ambition Gold highlight

**Animation**:
- Timeline scrolls slowly (player can scrub forward/backward with scroll input)
- Game cards fade in as they enter viewport (0.4s per card)
- Studio portraits appear at end with "where are they now" text (0.6s fade-in per studio)
- Final rank badges: Stamp animation (reusing greenlight stamp assets, 1.2s each, staggered)

**Audio**:
- Reflective piano score (minor key, nostalgic, slightly melancholic)
- Ambient sounds fade out as timeline progresses (leaving the office behind)
- Final rank reveal: Satisfying stamp sound (callback to core loop)

**Narrative Text** (voiceover or on-screen text):
- S-Rank: "You built something that mattered. Studios trusted you. Players loved your library. The industry remembers your name."
- A-Rank: "You succeeded. The board was happy. The games sold. You made your mark."
- B-Rank: "You survived. Some hits, some misses. You kept the lights on."
- C-Rank: "You struggled. The board lost faith. Studios moved on. But you finished."
- D-Rank: "The board was right to worry. You left more wreckage than legacy."

## 11. Motion Design Principles

### Animation Philosophy

**Every animation must serve one of three purposes**:
1. **Feedback** — Confirming player input ("You clicked this, and I heard you")
2. **Transition** — Guiding attention between states ("Here's where we're going")
3. **Emotion** — Amplifying narrative weight ("This moment matters")

If an animation doesn't serve one of these, cut it.

### Timing Curves (Easing Functions)

| Curve Type | Use Case | Easing Function |
|---|---|---|
| **Ease-Out** | Elements entering screen, feedback appearing | cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1) |
| **Ease-In** | Elements leaving screen, dismissing UI | cubic-bezier(0.42, 0, 1, 1) |
| **Ease-In-Out** | State changes, morphs, value transitions | cubic-bezier(0.42, 0, 0.58, 1) |
| **Bounce** (subtle) | Satisfying feedback, stamp landing | cubic-bezier(0.68, -0.55, 0.27, 1.55) |
| **Linear** | Progress bars filling, timers | linear |

### Duration Guidelines

| Animation Type | Min Duration | Max Duration | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| Button press feedback | 0.1s | 0.2s | Instant, responsive |
| Tooltip appearance | 0.2s | 0.3s | Quick but not jarring |
| Panel transitions | 0.4s | 0.6s | Smooth, readable |
| State morphs (bars, gauges) | 0.6s | 1.2s | Allows player to track change |
| Cinematic moments (stamp, montage) | 1.0s | 2.0s | Satisfying, weighty |

**Rule**: No animation should delay player input. If an animation locks the UI for more than 0.3s, it's too long.

### Stagger and Sequencing

**When multiple elements animate simultaneously**:
- Stagger by 0.05-0.1s per element (creates rhythm, not chaos)
- Animate from a clear origin point (top-to-bottom, left-to-right, center-outward)
- Max 5 elements in a stagger sequence (beyond that, instant reveal with 0.2s fade-in)

**Example**: Annual review game cards
- 12 games shipped this year
- Stagger: 0.1s per card
- Total sequence: 1.2s to reveal all
- Feels dynamic, not overwhelming

### Micro-Interactions

**Hover States**:
- Scale: 102-105% (subtle growth)
- Shadow: Increase blur by 2px, increase opacity by 10%
- Color: Lighten by 5-10%
- Duration: 0.2s
- Never combine more than 2 hover effects (e.g., scale + shadow is enough)

**Button Press**:
- Scale: 98% (brief compression)
- Duration: 0.1s down, 0.15s return
- Shadow: Remove outer shadow, add inner shadow (1px inset)
- Feel: Mechanical, satisfying

**Value Changes** (numbers updating):
- Count-up animation for increases: 0.6s duration, ease-out
- Count-down animation for decreases: 0.6s duration, ease-in
- Color flash: Brief highlight (0.3s) in Publisher Green (gain) or Budget Red (loss)

**Loading States**:
- Skeleton screens (gray placeholder boxes) rather than spinners
- Subtle pulse (90-100% opacity, 1.5s cycle)
- Never block the entire UI — load in layers (load core first, details second)

### Physics and Realism

**Avoid**:
- Overly bouncy animations (cheap, distracting)
- Unrealistic speeds (elements shouldn't "teleport" unless instant feedback is needed)
- Rotation for no reason (spinning UI elements are rarely justified)

**Embrace**:
- Subtle inertia (elements "settle" into place with minimal overshoot)
- Gravity-inspired downward motion (cards "land" on desk, don't float)
- Consistent direction (all panels slide from same direction within a screen type)

## 12. Accessibility Considerations

### Visual Accessibility

**Color Blindness Support**:
- All critical information uses color + iconography (never color alone)
- High contrast mode available (7:1 contrast ratio minimum)
- Patterns and textures supplement color coding (e.g., hatched fill for negative bars, solid for positive)

**Low Vision Support**:
- UI scale options: 100%, 125%, 150%
- Font size override in accessibility settings (independent of UI scale)
- Focus indicators: 2px outline, high contrast, always visible during keyboard navigation

**Screen Reader Support**:
- All interactive elements have ARIA labels
- Dynamic content updates announce to screen readers ("Budget decreased by $5 million")
- Landmark regions defined (navigation, main content, sidebar, footer)
- Skip-to-content links for keyboard users

### Motor Accessibility

**Keyboard Navigation**:
- All UI reachable via Tab key
- Logical tab order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom)
- Escape key dismisses modals, tooltips
- Enter/Space activate buttons, confirm selections
- Arrow keys navigate lists, grids, and card collections

**Interaction Timing**:
- No time-limited decisions (player can pause anytime)
- No rapid button mashing required
- Hover tooltips can be "sticky" (click to pin, click again to dismiss) for users who can't hold hover

**Reduced Motion Mode**:
- Disables all decorative animations
- Retains functional animations (feedback, transitions) at minimal duration (0.1s)
- Crossfades replace slides, scales, and complex motion

### Cognitive Accessibility

**Information Clarity**:
- Plain language (avoid jargon where possible, define industry terms on first use)
- Consistent terminology (don't call the same thing by three different names)
- Visual hierarchy guides attention (headlines, subheads, body text clearly distinct)

**Decision Support**:
- Tooltips provide context for complex decisions
- Undo/confirm for destructive actions (Cancel Project requires two-step confirmation)
- Summary screens before commitment (greenlight shows full dossier before stamp comes down)

**Cognitive Load Management**:
- Progressive disclosure (show summary, expand for detail)
- Filters and sorting tools for long lists
- Clear visual separation between sections (whitespace, dividers)

### Auditory Accessibility

**Audio Cues** (optional):
- All audio has visual equivalent (sound effect + notification text)
- Subtitles/captions for any voiceover (if implemented)
- No critical information conveyed by audio alone

---

## 13. Marketing and Promotional Art Direction

### Key Art (Hero Image)

**Composition**:
- Overhead shot of a mahogany conference table
- Scattered pitch documents, focus group reports, coffee mug (half-empty)
- Center: The greenlight stamp glowing (Publisher Green ring active)
- Around table edges: Silhouettes of studio reps leaning in (one confident, one nervous, one desperate)
- Executive's hand hovering over stamp button (visible in bottom third)

**Mood**: Anticipation. The moment before the decision. Everything at stake, nothing resolved yet.

**Color Treatment**:
- Warm wood tones (mahogany table)

- Tagline and key art (right side)

### Animated Trailer Style Guide

**Pacing**: 90-120 seconds total. Three-act structure.

**Act 1 (0-30s): The Pitch**
- Cold open: A studio pitching a game (voiceover or text on screen)
- Visuals: Pitch dossier card filling in, studio portrait, concept art
- Player's hand hovering over stamp
- Tension: "Do you believe?"

**Act 2 (30-75s): The Consequences**
- Time-lapse: Milestone reviews, interventions, era events
- Montage: Multiple games in development, some succeeding, some failing
- Morale bars draining, trust scores rising, budget overruns
- Studio emails: Thank-yous and complaints
- Board evaluation: Triangle reshaping, board members reacting

**Act 3 (75-90s): The Legacy**
- Metacritic scores appearing
- Games shipping (box art on shelves, review quotes)
- Studios reacting (celebrating or closing)
- Final shot: The greenlight stamp coming down one more time
- Title card: "GREENLIGHT" + release window

**Audio**: Corporate ambience (keyboard clicks, HVAC hum) layered under subtle orchestral score. Build from quiet tension to emotional climax.

**Text on Screen**:
- "You're the publisher."
- "You decide which dreams get funded."
- "Every greenlight is a bet."
- "Every bet has a legacy."

### Social Media Assets

- Content area: Announcement text, screenshot, or feature callout
- Branding: Logo (top-left corner, 200px width)

**GIF-able Moments** (for marketing, social media):
1. Greenlight stamp animation (1.2s loop)
2. Morale bar draining (dramatic failure state, 2s)
3. Portfolio triangle morphing (success to crisis, 3s loop)
4. Email notification popping in (0.5s)
5. Metacritic score reveal (2s, building anticipation)

## 14. Platform-Specific Adaptations

### PC (Steam) — Primary Platform

**Optimizations**:
- Native resolution support: 1280x720 to 3840x2160
- Ultra-wide monitor support: 21:9 and 32:9 aspect ratios (UI scales horizontally, maintains readability)
- Mouse-driven interaction (all UI optimized for cursor precision)
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users (Tab to cycle pitches, Enter to greenlight, Esc to pass, etc.)

**Steam-Specific Features**:
- Steam Trading Cards: 6 cards featuring studio portraits and iconic game concepts
- Achievements: "Legacy" achievement for S-rank, "Cancelled" achievement for firing a lead designer, "Patron" for earning 5 studios' trust
- Workshop Support (potential): Community-created studio/pitch packs

**UI Adjustments**: None needed (this is the baseline design).

### Nintendo Switch — Secondary Platform

**Optimizations**:
- Handheld mode readability: All text minimum 16px at 1280x720
- Touch support: All buttons minimum 88px touch target in handheld mode
- Dock/undock scaling: UI elements scale 1.5x when docking to maintain visual density
- Controller navigation: Face buttons confirm/cancel, D-pad/thumbstick navigate, triggers quick-scroll

**Switch-Specific Considerations**:
- **Suspend/Resume**: Player can suspend mid-decision, resume without losing context (autosave at every decision point)
- **HD Rumble**: Subtle haptic feedback on greenlight stamp (mechanical "thunk" translated to rumble)
- **Screenshot Sharing**: UI designed to be screenshot-worthy (no HUD clutter in key moments)

**UI Adjustments**:
- Increase button sizes by 25% in handheld mode (touchscreen targets)
- Simplified tooltip system (tap to reveal, tap again to dismiss — no hover state)
- On-screen button prompts (A to confirm, B to cancel, Y to counter-offer, X to view details)

### Mobile Tablet (Stretch Goal)

**Optimizations**:
- Touch-first redesign: All primary actions are tap-based (no hover states)
- Gesture support: Swipe left to pass, swipe right to greenlight, tap to view details
- Simplified UI: Reduce on-screen elements (collapsible sidebars, full-screen focus on pitch card)
- Portrait and landscape orientation support (UI reflows dynamically)

**Tablet-Specific Considerations**:
- **Session Length**: Mobile sessions likely shorter (20-30 min). Support "quick play" mode (one fiscal quarter, save and exit).
- **Touch Precision**: Minimum 160px touch targets for primary actions, 120px for secondary.
- **Performance**: Aggressive texture compression (ASTC on iOS, ETC2 on Android). Lower particle counts. 30fps target acceptable.

**UI Adjustments**:
- Greenlight Table: Single-column layout (portrait), pitch dossier occupies 80% of screen, stamp button bottom-fixed
- Milestone Review: Vertical scroll layout (status bars stack vertically, intervention buttons scroll horizontally)
- Board Evaluation: Simplified triangle (smaller, 400px), game cards in vertical scrolling list instead of grid

## 16. Validation and Iteration Plan

### Playtest Focus Areas

**Test 1: First Impressions (5-minute session)**
- Show player the Greenlight Table for the first time.
- Can they identify what they're supposed to do without tutorial text?
- Does the pitch dossier feel readable or overwhelming?
- Does the stamp interaction feel satisfying?

**Success Metrics**:
- 80% of testers understand the core verb within 1 minute
- 90% successfully greenlight or pass a pitch within 2 minutes
- Post-test question: "Did the stamp feel satisfying?" — Target 70% "yes"

**Test 2: Information Hierarchy (15-minute session)**
- Player evaluates 5 pitches in a row.
- Track: What information do they look at? Eye-tracking if available, verbal protocol if not.
- Do they rely on Gut-Feel Indicator, or do they read full dossier?
- Are they missing critical info (risk flags, studio morale)?

**Success Metrics**:
- Primary info (Gut-Feel, Budget, Studio Name) viewed by 100% of players
- Secondary info (Risk Flags, Timeline) viewed by 70%+ when relevant
- No tester says "I didn't see that" about info that was visible on screen

**Test 3: Emotional Engagement (30-minute session)**
- Player completes 1 fiscal year (4 quarters, ~10 decisions).
- Post-test interview: Do you remember any studio names? Do you care what happens to any project?
- Watch for: Do they hesitate before cancelling a project? Do they celebrate a success?

**Success Metrics**:
- 60% of players remember at least one studio name unprompted
- 50% express emotional reaction (positive or negative) to at least one outcome
- Cancellation decisions take 2x longer on average than greenlight decisions (indicating weight)

**Test 4: Readability at Scale (45-minute session)**
- Player manages 5 active projects simultaneously (late-game complexity).
- Does the milestone review phase feel overwhelming or manageable?
- Are they making informed intervention decisions, or clicking randomly?

**Success Metrics**:
- Players successfully prioritize (address high-risk projects first) in 70% of sessions
- No tester reports "I couldn't tell which project needed attention"
- Intervention decisions take 15-30s on average (not instant, not agonizing)

**Test 5: Accessibility Validation (30-minute session, specialized testers)**
- Recruit testers with: color blindness, low vision, motor impairments
- Test: Keyboard navigation, screen reader, high contrast mode, reduced motion mode
- Collect feedback on pain points

**Success Metrics**:
- All interactive elements reachable via keyboard (100%)
- Screen reader announces all critical state changes (100%)
- High contrast mode passes WCAG 2.1 Level AA automated tests
- No tester reports a blocking issue (bugs are acceptable, design flaws are not)

### Iteration Triggers

**Minor Iteration** (adjust within sprint):
- Single tester reports confusion on a specific UI element
- Animation timing feels slightly off (too fast/slow by <0.2s)
- Color choice creates minor readability issue in one context

**Major Iteration** (requires design review and possible rework):
- 30%+ of testers fail to understand a core mechanic within 5 minutes
- Emotional engagement is low (players don't remember studios, don't care about outcomes)
- Accessibility violation (WCAG fail, blocking issue for disabled players)

**Show-Stopper** (halt production, full redesign):
- Core loop isn't fun (greenlight stamp doesn't feel satisfying in 50%+ of tests)
- Information overload is universal (90%+ of testers report feeling overwhelmed)
- Technical constraint violated (UI doesn't run at 60fps, or exceeds memory budget by >20%)

### Success Criteria for Art Direction

**At Gold Master, the game must**:
1. Pass squint test on all screens (readable at 5 feet / 40% scale)
2. Pass colorblind tests (all critical info distinguishable)
3. Pass WCAG 2.1 Level AA automated accessibility tests
4. Run at 60fps on target hardware (PC: GTX 1060 equivalent, Switch: docked mode)
5. Greenlight stamp interaction rated "satisfying" by 70%+ of playtesters
6. Players remember at least one studio name after 30-minute session (60%+ of testers)
7. No UI state where critical information is hidden or inaccessible

**If any of these fail at final playtest, art direction requires rework before ship.**

## Final Notes

This is a game about human decisions rendered through corporate interfaces. The art direction succeeds if:

- The player sees the systems clearly (legible, organized, professional)
- The player feels the stakes emotionally (portraits, emails, consequences)
- The stamp coming down never feels routine

Show me the greenlight table, and I'll know if this game works. If the pitch dossier is readable in 10 seconds, if the studio portrait makes eye contact, if the stamp animation makes me hesitate — even for a fraction of a second — before committing, then we've found the visual identity.

Art is communication. Every pixel earns its place. The numbers matter, but the people behind the numbers matter more. That tension, visualized, is GREENLIGHT.
