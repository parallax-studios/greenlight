## 0. PREFACE: LEVEL DESIGN FOR A DECISION GAME

This is not a spatial game. There are no corridors. No sightlines in the traditional sense. No jump arcs to tune.

But there IS level design here -- because level design is about flow, pacing, and the player's attention. Every conference room is a combat arena. Every quarterly cycle is a level. Every fiscal year is an act with rising and falling action. The player MOVES through time, through decision trees, through consequence cascades. They LOOK at studio faces, pitch dossiers, morale bars. The breadcrumbs are UI elements that pulse for attention. The bosses are quarterly earnings calls.

Where does the player LOOK? Where does their attention go when three pitches demand simultaneous evaluation? That's sightline design.

Where does the player MOVE? Through the quarterly structure, from greenlight to milestone to consequence. That's flow design.

What does the pacing curve feel like? When do they breathe? When do they panic? That's encounter design.

This document approaches GREENLIGHT as a series of designed experiences -- levels measured in quarters, not meters. Each section of the campaign has a purpose, a flow, and specific breadcrumbs that teach the player where to look next.

Let me show you the map.

## 1. CAMPAIGN STRUCTURE: THE 10-YEAR ARC

### 1.1 Level Purpose Statement

**GREENLIGHT is a 10-year campaign that teaches the player to make decisions with incomplete information, then systematically complexifies the decision space until the same simple verb -- greenlight or pass -- transforms into legacy management.**

The full campaign is 10 fiscal years (2003-2012), 40 quarters, 12-18 hours. Each year is a "level" with a purpose statement, emotional beat, and teaching objective.

```

**ACT ONE: LEARNING PHASE (Years 1-3, Quarters 1-12)**
- **Purpose**: Establish the core loop. Teach the verbs. Provide grace.
- **Emotional Beat**: From fear to confidence. "I can do this."
- **Complexity Level**: LOW. 3-4 active project slots. 6-8 studios in pool. Simple interventions. Forgiving board targets.

**ACT TWO: DISRUPTION PHASE (Years 4-7, Quarters 13-28)**
- **Purpose**: Destabilize mastery. Force adaptation. Introduce systemic pressures.
- **Emotional Beat**: From confidence to weight. "This is harder than I thought."
- **Complexity Level**: MEDIUM-HIGH. 5 active slots. 10-12 studios. Era events accelerate. Board demands specialization. Studio relationships mature and fracture.

**ACT THREE: MASTERY PHASE (Years 8-10, Quarters 29-40)**
- **Purpose**: Test everything. No new systems. Pure execution.
- **Emotional Beat**: From weight to reckoning. "This is who I became."
- **Complexity Level**: MAXIMUM. 6 active slots. 12-15 studios. All systems interact. Long-term investments pay off or collapse. Legacy becomes visible.

### 1.3 The Critical Path

The player MUST move through this sequence to complete the campaign:

1. **The Kill Order** (Year 1 Q1) -- Tutorial decision. Pass/fail teaches consequences.
2. **The First Greenlight** (Year 1 Q1) -- Core loop established.
3. **The First Ship** (Year 1 Q4 - Year 2 Q1) -- First Metacritic score. Consequence arrives.
4. **The First Intervention** (Year 1 Q2) -- Management verb unlocked.
5. **The First Board Review** (Year 1 Q4) -- Portfolio pressure introduced.
6. **The Platform Gamble** (Year 3 Q4 - Year 4 Q2) -- Xbox 360 / next-gen pivot. Strategic fork.
7. **The Wii Disruption** (Year 4 Q4) -- Market disruption. Adaptation test.
8. **The First Studio Departure** (contextual, Years 3-6) -- Consequence of broken trust. Teaches that studios are not permanent.
9. **The Mid-Game Crisis** (Year 5-6) -- A studio the player believed in is struggling. Recession may compound. Intervention or restraint. High-stakes moment.
10. **The Magnum Opus Offer** (contextual, Years 5-8) -- If Trust is high, a studio pitches their defining work. Player's biggest bet.
11. **The Voss Email** (contextual, Year 5+) -- Founder breaks silence. Reflects player's identity.
12. **The Final Greenlight** (Year 10 Q3) -- Last chance to shape legacy.
13. **The Final Board Review** (Year 10 Q4) -- Legacy evaluation. Montage. Credits.

Not all of these moments are scripted events. Many emerge from the systemic relationships (studio departures, magnum opus offers, crises). But the critical path ensures that key teaching moments and emotional beats are guaranteed.

## 2. YEAR-BY-YEAR BREAKDOWN: LEVEL DESIGN PER FISCAL YEAR

### YEAR 1 (2003): THE INHERITANCE

**Level Purpose**: Establish the core loop. Teach the greenlight verb, the intervention verb, and the consequence chain. Provide a safe space to fail without campaign-ending penalties.

**Emotional Beat**: From fear (the kill order) to tentative control (first successful ship).

**Flow Diagram**:

```
Q1: KILL ORDER -> GREENLIGHT TABLE (3 pitches, 2 slots) -> 2 projects active
     |
     v
Q2: MILESTONE REVIEW -> First Intervention tutorial -> Era Event: Xbox Live
     |
     v
Q3: GREENLIGHT TABLE (4 pitches, 2 slots) -> E3 SHOWCASE decision -> 3-4 active
     |
     v
Q4: FIRST SHIP -> Metacritic lands -> Board Review -> ANNUAL EVALUATION

    Q1        Q2        Q3        Q4
  (Kill)  (Intervene) (E3)    (Ship/Board)
```

**Encounter Breakdown**:

| Quarter | Primary Encounter | Pressure Source | Teaching Objective |
|---------|------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Q1 | The Kill Order + First Greenlight | Inherited crisis + budget scarcity | Teach that decisions have weight. Greenlight is not free. |
| Q2 | First Milestone Review | Studio morale + budget | Teach Intervention System. Restraint is an option. |
| Q3 | E3 Showcase + Expanded Pitch Pool | Attention scarcity (which games to spotlight?) | Teach opportunity cost. You cannot spotlight everything. |
| Q4 | First Ship + First Board Review | Metacritic consequence + Portfolio Matrix intro | Teach that outcomes arrive months after decisions. Board evaluates the whole, not the parts. |

**Breadcrumbing Strategy**:

- **Kill Order decision**: Two buttons. One red (Cancel), one amber (Extend). The amber button glows faintly. The flavor text for Extend references "belief in second chances." The breadcrumb toward the emotionally harder, mechanically riskier choice is subtle. Players who follow it learn that mercy has costs. Players who kill learn that cruelty is efficient but noticed.
- **First Greenlight Table**: Only 3 pitches, 2 slots. One pitch is clearly strong (high studio capability, good market fit, green gut-feel). One pitch is clearly weak. One pitch is ambiguous. The strong pitch teaches "this is what good looks like." The ambiguous pitch teaches "sometimes you guess." The weak pitch teaches "passing is also a decision."
- **First Intervention**: Tutorial pop-up appears but does not block the screen. It highlights the "Restraint" option first, then lists interventions second. The default is to do nothing. The player must CHOOSE to act. This is sacred. Intervention is not the expected path.
- **First Board Review**: The Portfolio Matrix appears for the first time. Each axis has a visual explanation tied to a specific game the player shipped. "Project Falcon scored 88 on Metacritic. Prestige +12." The abstraction is made concrete through attribution.

**Difficulty Considerations**:

- **Grace Period**: Board targets are lenient. Budget is sufficient for moderate mistakes. Studio morale starts neutral-to-positive across the roster. No studio will leave in Year 1 regardless of trust damage (they give the new executive a chance).
- **Failure State**: The player CAN fail the Year 1 board review, but the consequence is a warning, not termination. The board says: "We understand this is a transition year. Year 2 expectations are higher."
- **Variant for Expert Players**: On replay, the Kill Order context is richer -- players who read archived emails discover that the project being killed has a 30% chance of recovering if extended. First-time players guess. Expert players know.

**Playtesting Metrics**:

- **Time to First Greenlight Decision**: Target 60-90 seconds (including reading the tutorial). If under 30 seconds, players are not reading. If over 2 minutes, information overload.
- **Kill Order Outcome Distribution**: Track what % of players Cancel vs. Extend. Ideal split: 50/50 or 60/40 either direction. If 80%+ choose one option, the stakes are not balanced.
- **First Intervention Rate**: What % of players intervene vs. hold in Q2? Target: 60% intervene (they are exploring the new verb), 40% hold (they are testing restraint). If 90%+ intervene, restraint does not feel like a real option.
- **Year 1 Completion Rate**: 95%+ of players should complete Year 1. If drop-off exceeds 10%, the onboarding is failing.

---

### YEAR 2 (2004): THE FIRST CONSEQUENCES

**Level Purpose**: Show the player that their Year 1 decisions are still paying dividends or debts. Introduce the Portfolio Matrix as a strategic constraint, not just a scorecard.

**Emotional Beat**: "I see how the pieces connect now."

**Flow Diagram**:

```
Q1: Year 1 games finish shipping -> Reviews land -> Studio reactions arrive
     |
     v
Q2: Greenlight Table (4 pitches, 2 slots, tighter budget) -> Sequel pitches appear (if applicable)
     |
     v
Q3: Milestone reviews multiply -> Intervention decisions stack -> E3
     |
     v
Q4: Portfolio Matrix pressure -> Board demands axis improvement -> Annual review
```

 (Delayed    (Squeeze) (Multi-    (Portfolio
 Consequences)          Manage)    Judgment)
```

**Encounter Breakdown**:

| Quarter | Primary Encounter | Pressure Source | Teaching Objective |
|---------|------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Q1 | Delayed Consequences | Year 1 ships arriving. Metacritic scores reflecting old decisions. | Teach longitudinal decision-making. The choices you made 9 months ago define today. |
| Q2 | Budget Squeeze | More pitches than slots. Board scrutiny higher. | Teach portfolio strategy. Saying no becomes harder. |
| Q3 | Multi-Project Management | 4 active projects, 2-3 milestones this quarter. | Teach attention triage. Not every project needs deep focus. Learn to skim. |
| Q4 | Portfolio Pressure | Board targets tighten. One axis is probably underperforming. | Teach that the Portfolio Matrix is not just feedback -- it gates future options. |

**Breadcrumbing Strategy**:

- **Studio Reaction Emails**: Games that shipped in Q4 of Year 1 generate studio emails in Q1 of Year 2. High-scoring games produce thank-you emails that feel personal. Low-scoring games produce terse or wounded emails. The breadcrumb: "How you treat studios after failure matters as much as how you treat them during success." Players who respond warmly (via optional reply templates, if implemented) maintain trust. Players who ignore the emails lose trust passively.
- **Sequel Pitches**: If a Year 1 game scored above 75 and sold well, a sequel pitch appears in Q2 or Q3. The sequel pitch has a green flag: "Franchise Opportunity." The pitch is cheaper, faster, and lower-risk than a new IP. The breadcrumb toward the sequel is a glowing path. The game wants you to take it. Resist if you want Prestige. Follow if you want Profit. The choice is yours, but the game has shown you the easy path.
- **Board Target Highlighting**: In Q4, the board review screen highlights the underperforming axis in pulsing red. Beneath it, a line reads: "Upcoming pitch pool contains [X] high-Prestige opportunities." The breadcrumb: "We see your problem. We are giving you the tools to fix it. Will you?"

**Difficulty Considerations**:

- **Tightening Window**: Budget grows slightly (+$10M), but board expectations grow faster. The player feels the squeeze.
- **First Real Failure Risk**: If the player badly mismanaged Year 1 (multiple cancelled projects, broken studios, missed board targets), Year 2 is where the consequences compound. This is intentional. The pain should arrive after the player understands the systems well enough to know what they did wrong.
- **Variant for Struggling Players**: If the player ended Year 1 below board targets on 2+ axes, the board offers a "grace extension" with a warning. The difficulty ramps more slowly. If the player ended Year 1 above targets, no grace -- expectations immediately escalate.

**Playtesting Metrics**:

- **Sequel Greenlight Rate**: What % of players greenlight the first sequel pitch vs. passing for new IP? Target: 60-70% greenlight (most players take the safe path). If under 40%, sequels are not attractive enough. If over 85%, sequels are too strong (risk/reward balance needs tuning).
- **Portfolio Axis Distribution**: By end of Year 2, how are players distributed across the Prestige/Profit/Populism triangle? Ideal: diverse distribution. No single strategy dominates. If 70%+ of players cluster in one zone (e.g., high Profit, low Prestige), the incentive structure is unbalanced.
- **Intervention Frequency**: Are players intervening more or less than Year 1? Track average interventions per project per quarter. Expect a slight increase as players gain confidence, but if it spikes above 1.5 interventions per project per quarter, players are not learning restraint.

---

### YEAR 3 (2005): THE PLATFORM GAMBLE

**Level Purpose**: Introduce the first major strategic fork. The Xbox 360 launches. The player must decide whether to pivot to next-gen early or ride the PS2 install base. This decision has multi-year consequences.

**Emotional Beat**: "I am making a bet I won't know was right for two years."

**Flow Diagram**:

```
Q1-Q2: Rumors of Xbox 360 -> Pitch pool shifts -> Studios ask about next-gen plans
     |
     v
Q3: Xbox 360 announcement (E3 placeholder) -> Next-gen pitches available

```

**Encounter Breakdown**:

| Quarter | Primary Encounter | Pressure Source | Teaching Objective |
|---------|------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Q1 | Era Event: Rumors | News ticker: "Microsoft exec hints at next-gen console for Holiday 2005." | Teach telegraphed disruption. The game is telling you what's coming. |
| Q2 | Studio Questions | Milestone reviews include notes: "Studio asks if this project should target next-gen hardware." | Teach that studios are aware of the market. They look to you for direction. |
| Q3 | E3 Reveal | Xbox 360 officially announced. Next-gen pitch templates unlocked. | Teach that the market has shifted. Current-gen is still viable but the clock is ticking. |
| Q4 | The Commitment | Greenlight Table includes 2-3 next-gen pitches (higher budget, higher risk, higher potential). Board evaluates your response to the shift. | Teach strategic commitment. Sitting on the fence is a choice with consequences. |

**Breadcrumbing Strategy**:

- **Rumor News Ticker**: Q1 and Q2 have news items with amber highlighting (not red crisis, not green opportunity -- amber uncertainty). "Industry analysts predict next-gen transition by 2006." "Studios reportedly prototyping on next-gen dev kits." The breadcrumb: "This is not background noise. This is the weather changing."
- **Gut-Feel Modifier for Next-Gen Pitches**: Next-gen pitches have wider variance in their Gut-Feel Indicator. The Quality_Seed formula includes an "era match" term that the player cannot see yet. A next-gen pitch greenlit in Q3 2005 for a Q4 2006 ship window will benefit from the install base growth. A next-gen pitch rushed for Q2 2006 will suffer from small audience. The breadcrumb is invisible but systemic: patient players who wait for the install base to mature will see better outcomes.
- **Board Question**: In the Q4 board review, the board explicitly asks: "What is Stonebridge's next-gen strategy?" This is not flavor text. The next year's pitch pool composition will shift based on your Year 3 greenlights. If you funded zero next-gen projects, fewer studios will pitch next-gen in Year 4 (they assume you're not interested). If you funded 2+ next-gen projects, the pitch pool skews next-gen. The breadcrumb: your greenlights shape the future decision space.

**Difficulty Considerations**:

- **No Correct Answer**: Both strategies are viable. A player who goes all-in on next-gen early takes higher risk but positions for Year 5-6 dominance. A player who rides PS2 through 2006 banks safer revenue but may lose momentum in Year 6-7. The difficulty is in committing, not in choosing correctly.
- **Hybrid Path**: Players can hedge with a mixed portfolio (1 next-gen project, 2 current-gen projects). This is safer but produces a less distinct publisher identity. The Portfolio Matrix reflects this: hybrid portfolios have moderate scores across all axes but rarely spike any axis above 70.
- **Failure Mode**: Players who ignore the shift entirely and greenlight only PS2 projects through Year 5 will see revenue per title decline as the install base fragments. The board will pressure them in Year 5-6. This is a slow bleed, not a sudden death.

**Playtesting Metrics**:

- **Next-Gen Adoption Rate**: What % of players greenlight at least 1 next-gen project in Year 3? Target: 60-75%. If under 40%, the incentives are not clear. If over 85%, the risk is not apparent.
- **Next-Gen Timing**: For players who greenlight next-gen projects, what is the average ship date? Are they rushing for Q1-Q2 2006 (risky) or waiting for Q4 2006+ (patient)? Track correlation between ship date and Metacritic outcome.
- **Board Satisfaction in Year 3**: Does going next-gen early correlate with lower Year 3 board scores (due to higher costs, narrower audience)? It should. The payoff comes in Year 5-6. If next-gen players are equally satisfied as current-gen players in Year 3, the risk/reward is not calibrated.

---

### YEAR 4 (2006): THE WII DISRUPTION

**Level Purpose**: Destabilize the player's strategy. The Wii launches and explodes. Casual gaming becomes a board mandate. The player must adapt or resist.

**Emotional Beat**: "The rules just changed and I don't know if my portfolio survives this."

**Flow Diagram**:

```
Q1-Q2: PS3 launches at $599 (troubled) -> Next-gen costs spike -> Budget pressure
     |
     v
Q3: E3 -> Wii reveal -> Casual/motion-control pitches unlock
     |
     v

```

**Encounter Breakdown**:

| Quarter | Primary Encounter | Pressure Source | Teaching Objective |
|---------|------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Q1-Q2 | PS3 Troubled Launch | News ticker: "$599 price point. Slow adoption." Next-gen projects targeting PS3-exclusive face narrower audience. | Teach that platform bets carry risk even after you commit. |
| Q3 | E3 Wii Reveal | Motion controls. Casual audience targeting. Disruption is visible months before it hits. | Teach telegraphed disruption again, but this time it's weirder. Harder to read. |
| Q4 | Wii Explosion + Board Mandate | Wii install base grows 3x faster than Xbox 360 in year 1. Board review includes explicit demand: "What is our casual gaming strategy?" | Teach that the market can demand you pivot to spaces you did not prepare for. Adaptation is not optional. |

**Breadcrumbing Strategy**:

- **Studio Archetype Responses**: When Wii pitches appear, studio archetypes respond differently. Reliable studios (Doug's Ironclad Games) can pivot easily -- their Wii pitch has low morale cost. Auteur studios (Sato's Cathedral) refuse to pitch for Wii or do so with visible contempt ("This is not the audience for our work"). The breadcrumb: the Wii opportunity is real, but it fractures your studio relationships along archetype lines. Choose carefully.
- **Focus Group Data**: Wii pitches come with focus group reports that show off-the-charts "mainstream appeal" scores but middling "core gamer" scores. The breadcrumb: this is Populism rocket fuel, but Prestige is at risk. The Portfolio Matrix trade-off is visible in the data before you greenlight.
- **Board Mandate Phrasing**: The board does not say "You must greenlight a Wii game." It says "The board expects a response to the casual gaming disruption." The breadcrumb: you have agency in how you respond. You can greenlight a Wii game. You can double down on core gaming and accept the Populism hit. You can do nothing and take the board penalty. The game presents the pressure but does not dictate the solution.

**Difficulty Considerations**:

- **Portfolio Fracture Risk**: This is where the player's Year 3 strategy collides with Year 4 reality. A player who went all-in on next-gen core gaming (action games, RPGs, shooters for Xbox 360/PS3) now faces a market that rewards casual party games. The board wants Populism. The player's studio roster may not be equipped to deliver it. This is the mid-game crisis for one strategic path.
- **Opportunity for Lagging Players**: A player who struggled in Years 1-3 can use the Wii disruption as a reset. Casual games are cheaper, faster, and have explosive revenue potential. A well-timed Wii bet can save a struggling portfolio. The difficulty curve has a "catch-up" path here.
- **Auteur Studio Crisis Point**: If the player has been nurturing an Auteur studio (Sato's Cathedral), Year 4 is the stress test. The board wants Populism. Sato wants to make *Lithograph*, a narrative art game for core audiences. The player must choose: protect the relationship or serve the board. This is the first time the game forces a clear, unambiguous sacrifice.

**Playtesting Metrics**:

- **Casual Gaming Adoption**: What % of players greenlight at least one Wii/casual project in Year 4? Target: 70-80%. The board pressure should push most players to respond. If under 50%, the pressure is not strong enough. If over 90%, the player feels they have no choice (agency is lost).
- **Auteur Studio Retention**: For players with high-Trust Auteur studios entering Year 4, what % lose that studio by end of Year 5? Track correlation with board pressure response. If ignoring the board to protect Auteur relationships is viable, good. If it's always punished, bad.
- **Portfolio Variance**: By end of Year 4, player portfolios should be more diverse (or more polarized) than Year 3. Track the spread of Prestige/Profit/Populism scores. Expect wider variance. The Wii disruption should create strategic forks, not convergence.

### YEARS 5-6 (2007-2008): THE MID-GAME GAUNTLET

**Level Purpose**: Maximum systemic pressure. Digital distribution. DLC economy. Recession. Studio relationships mature or fracture. Long-term bets from Years 3-4 pay off or collapse. No new core systems. Pure execution under compounding forces.

**Emotional Beat**: "Every decision I make now is built on decisions I made years ago, and I can't tell if the foundation is solid or crumbling."

**Flow Diagram** (compressed two-year view):

```
YEAR 5 (2007):
Q1-Q2: Digital distribution emerges -> Indie/Volatile studios pitch digital-only projects
Q3: E3 -> Prestige game era (BioShock/Portal/Mass Effect parallels) -> Auteur studios thrive or break
Q4: Long-term investments ship -> Metacritic results define trajectory

YEAR 6 (2008):
Q1-Q2: DLC economy formalizes -> Intervention: "Mandate DLC Plan" becomes strategic
Q3: Recession event -> Budget cut 15% -> Crisis management
Q4: Studio closures across industry -> Your weakest studio relationship faces existential threat

**Encounter Breakdown** (key moments across two years):

| Moment | Primary Encounter | Pressure Source | Teaching Objective |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Y5 Q2 | Digital Distribution Unlock | Low-budget, high-margin projects available. Indie studios pitch digital-only. | Teach new revenue model. Opportunity to diversify risk. |
| Y5 Q3 | Prestige Game Era | High-Metacritic games this year shift industry expectations. Board Prestige target increases. | Teach that the market raises the bar. Yesterday's 85 is today's 80. |
| Y5 Q4 | Magnum Opus Moment | If Trust is high with an Auteur studio, they pitch their career-defining work. Highest budget, highest risk, highest potential. | Teach that trust is a currency you spend on once-in-a-career bets. |
| Y6 Q1 | DLC Mandate Decision | Shipped games can now generate post-launch revenue. Do you mandate DLC during development (morale cost) or leave it optional (revenue loss)? | Teach that new revenue models have human costs. Optimization is not neutral. |
| Y6 Q3 | Recession Event | Budget cut 15%. Board freezes Profit target growth. Studios industry-wide have higher Desperation. | Teach crisis management. Scarcity creates opportunity (cheap acquisitions) and danger (studio closures). |
| Y6 Q4 | Studio Closure Threat | Your lowest-Trust or lowest-Morale studio sends a desperate email. They are weeks from insolvency. Do you intervene (cost: $5-10M emergency funding) or let them close? | Teach that relationships have life-or-death stakes. The player is not just managing projects -- they are holding studios' futures in their hands. |

- **Digital Distribution Introduction**: Q1-Q2 of Year 5, a news ticker reads: "Steam crosses 10 million users. Indie developers report profitable launches at sub-$5M budgets." The following quarter, Volatile studios begin pitching digital-only projects with green flags: "70% margin. No retail costs." The breadcrumb: this is a new path. It's glowing. Do you trust it?
- **Auteur Magnum Opus Trigger**: If the player has maintained Trust > +30 with an Auteur studio through Year 4's disruptions, a special pitch appears in Year 5 with unique framing. The pitch document is longer, more personal. The studio head's email reads: "This is the game I have been building toward my entire career. I will only make this offer once, and I will only make it to a publisher I trust." The breadcrumb: you earned this. It is not a random event. It is a reward for restraint and belief.
- **Recession Warning**: Year 6 opens with amber news tickers referencing housing markets, financial instability, economic concerns. By Q3, the recession event is telegraphed 1-2 quarters in advance. The breadcrumb: brace for impact. Players who built cash reserves (underspent their budget in Year 5) weather the storm better. Players who spent to the limit are exposed.
- **Studio Distress Signals**: The studio closure threat does not appear suddenly. It is breadcrumbed across 3-4 quarters. Morale drops. Milestone reports become terse. Emails shift from professional to strained. The studio stops sending jokes or personal notes. By the time the closure threat arrives, attentive players saw it coming. Inattentive players are blindsided. This is intentional. The game rewards attention to studio health as a long-game metric.

**Difficulty Considerations**:

- **Compounding Consequences**: Years 5-6 are where the player's Year 3-4 bets mature. A player who made good platform calls sees revenue and Metacritic spikes. A player who bet wrong sees portfolio stagnation or decline. The difficulty is asymmetric based on past performance. This is the "exam on material from two years ago."
- **Studio Relationship Payoffs**: High-Trust studios are delivering their best work. Low-Trust studios are underperforming or leaving. The relationship system's long-term consequences are now fully visible. A player who burned bridges in Years 2-3 is now working with a diminished studio pool. A player who cultivated relationships has access to the best pitches in the game.
- **Crisis Mode**: The recession in Year 6 Q3 is the campaign's sharpest difficulty spike. Budget cuts force hard choices. Do you cancel a struggling project to preserve cash? Do you reduce marketing spend and accept lower Populism? Do you cut a staff position (reduce active project slots)? The game does not tell you the right answer because there is no right answer. The crisis teaches that sometimes all options are bad and you choose the least bad.

**Playtesting Metrics**:

- **Magnum Opus Offer Rate**: What % of players receive a Magnum Opus pitch by end of Year 5? Target: 40-60%. It should feel rare but achievable. If under 25%, the Trust threshold is too high. If over 75%, it's not special.
- **Magnum Opus Greenlight Rate**: Of players who receive the offer, what % greenlight it? Target: 70-80%. The pitch should be compelling. If under 50%, the risk/reward is not attractive. If 95%+, it's a no-brainer (loses tension).
- **Recession Survival**: What % of players complete Year 6 without a board warning or termination threat? Target: 60-70%. The recession should hurt but not kill most players. Track correlation between Year 5 spending habits and Year 6 outcomes.
- **Studio Closure Decision**: In the studio closure moment, what % of players fund the emergency bailout vs. letting the studio close? Track correlation with studio archetype and Trust level. Expect higher bailout rates for high-Trust studios (emotional attachment) and Auteur studios (Prestige value).

### YEARS 7-8 (2009-2010): THE SPECIALIZATION DEMAND

**Level Purpose**: The board forces the player to commit to an identity. At least one Portfolio axis must exceed 70. The player can no longer be mediocre at everything. Choose who you are.

**Emotional Beat**: "I am no longer exploring. I am executing a vision I didn't realize I was building."

**Flow Diagram**:

```
YEAR 7 (2009):
Q1: Board Review -> New mandate: "One axis above 70 by end of Year 8"
Q2-Q4: Strategic greenlights -> Player doubles down on their dominant axis OR pivots to fix their weakest

YEAR 8 (2010):
Q1-Q3: Execution phase -> No new systems -> Portfolio optimization
Q4: Specialization evaluation -> Board assesses identity -> Doors open or close based on publisher type
```

**Pacing Curve**:

```

**Encounter Breakdown**:

| Year | Quarter | Primary Encounter | Pressure Source | Teaching Objective |
|------|---------|------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 7 | Q1 | Board Mandate | "At least one Portfolio axis above 70 by Year 8 Q4." | Teach that the board demands a clear identity. Balanced is no longer acceptable. |
| 7 | Q2-Q4 | Strategic Greenlighting | Pitch pool composition shifts based on your Year 6 portfolio. High-Prestige publishers attract Auteur pitches. High-Profit publishers attract franchise opportunities. | Teach that your past shapes your future options. The decision space is narrowing by your own hand. |
| 8 | Q1-Q3 | Execution Phase | No new mechanics. Pure management. Active projects from Year 7 are shipping. | Teach that late-game is about executing the strategy you built, not discovering new strategies. |
| 8 | Q4 | Identity Evaluation | Board Review explicitly names your publisher type: "Stonebridge is a Prestige-focused publisher" or "Stonebridge is a Profit-driven publisher" or "Stonebridge is a Populist publisher." | Teach that identity is not chosen in a menu. It is built through accumulated decisions. The game is telling you who you became. |

**Breadcrumbing Strategy**:

- **Axis-Specific Pitch Highlighting**: Starting in Year 7, pitches have visual tags indicating which axis they boost. High-Metacritic-potential pitches have a Prestige icon. Franchise sequels have a Profit icon. Casual/accessible games have a Populism icon. The breadcrumb: the game is showing you the tools to hit the board's target. Will you use them, or will you resist?
- **Studio Archetype Availability**: If the player has high Prestige (60+), more Auteur studios appear in the pitch pool. If high Profit, more Reliable studios. If high Populism, more Volatile studios pitching accessible games. The breadcrumb: the industry sees who you are and sends you pitches that match. Your identity is not just internal -- it's external and reputational.
- **Counter-Strategy Pitches**: If the player is heavily specialized in one axis (e.g., Prestige 75, Profit 40, Populism 35), the pitch pool will include 1-2 pitches per quarter that are explicitly counter-strategy (e.g., a guaranteed-profit sequel). The breadcrumb: the game is offering you a lifeline to balance your portfolio if you are falling behind on the other axes. Do you take it and dilute your identity, or ignore it and risk board penalties on weak axes?

**Difficulty Considerations**:

- **Identity Lock**: By end of Year 8, the player's publisher identity is visible and semi-permanent. A Prestige publisher will continue to attract Auteur pitches and high-Metacritic opportunities, but profit margins will be thin. A Profit publisher will print money but struggle to attract top-tier creative talent. A Populist publisher will dominate install base but face critical skepticism. The identity is not a failure state -- it's a play style that the game now reinforces.
- **Axis Minimum Enforcement**: Even as one axis spikes above 70, the board still enforces minimums on the other axes. A Prestige publisher with Prestige 78 but Profit 35 will face warnings: "Shareholders are concerned about profitability." The difficulty is not just specialization -- it's specialization without catastrophic neglect of the other axes.
- **Studio Departures Accelerate**: Low-fit studios begin leaving. An Auteur studio working for a Profit-focused publisher will have perpetually low morale and may leave for a rival. A Reliable studio working for a Prestige-focused publisher will pitch fewer sequels and more "stretch" projects that fail. The player must learn to let go of studios that do not match their identity.

**Playtesting Metrics**:

- **Axis Above 70 Achievement Rate**: What % of players achieve one axis above 70 by end of Year 8? Target: 75-85%. Most players should hit the target. If under 60%, the difficulty is too high (target needs adjustment). If over 95%, the target is too easy (raise to 75).
- **Portfolio Identity Distribution**: By end of Year 8, how are players distributed across Prestige/Profit/Populism specializations? Ideal: roughly even split (30-35-35 distribution). If one identity dominates (e.g., 60% of players are Profit-focused), the incentive structure favors that path (rebalance needed).
- **Studio Roster Churn**: Between Year 7 Q1 and Year 8 Q4, what % of studios in the active pitch pool change? Track studio departures and new studio arrivals. Expect 30-40% turnover. If under 20%, studios are too sticky (misfit studios should leave). If over 60%, studios are too volatile (trust/morale thresholds need adjustment).

### YEARS 9-10 (2011-2012): THE LEGACY PHASE

**Level Purpose**: No new mechanics. No new teaching. This is the final exam. All systems at maximum complexity. The player's decade of decisions culminates in a legacy evaluation that reflects every greenlight, every intervention, every studio relationship.

**Emotional Beat**: "This is who I became. This is what I built. I see it now, and I cannot change it -- only finish it."

**Flow Diagram**:

```
YEAR 9 (2011):
Q1-Q2: Mobile disruption -> Board asks "What is our mobile strategy?" -> Optional strategic pivot
Q3-Q4: Late-game bets ship -> High-variance outcomes -> Magnum Opus projects (if greenlit in Y5-7) deliver final results

YEAR 10 (2012):
Q1-Q2: Final greenlight cycle -> Last chance to shape legacy
Q3: Consolidation event -> Studio acquisition opportunities -> Spend reserves or preserve independence
Q4: Final Board Review -> Annual Evaluation -> LEGACY MONTAGE -> Credits
```

```

**Encounter Breakdown**:

| Year | Quarter | Primary Encounter | Pressure Source | Teaching Objective |
|------|---------|------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 9 | Q1 | Mobile Disruption | News ticker: mobile gaming revenue surpasses handheld. Board asks about mobile strategy. | Test adaptability one final time. Can the player pivot again, or are they locked into their identity? |
| 9 | Q3-Q4 | Late-Game Payoffs | Games greenlit in Years 5-7 are shipping. Magnum Opus projects deliver. Trust investments mature. | Teach that patience pays. The player sees the results of bets made 3-5 years ago. |
| 10 | Q1-Q2 | Final Greenlight Cycle | 4-5 pitches. 2-3 slots. The last games the player will ever greenlight for this publisher. | Test: does the player choose safe sequels to pad the legacy, or risky passion projects to end with a statement? |
| 10 | Q3 | Consolidation Event | Fading studios offer to sell to the player. Cost: $20-40M. Acquired studios become internal (no trust mechanics, reduced creativity). | Test: does the player preserve studio independence or consolidate for control? Thematic choice, not mechanical. |
| 10 | Q4 | Final Board Review + Legacy Montage | Board delivers the final Portfolio Matrix scores. Then: montage of every game greenlit, every studio relationship, every era event navigated. Legacy Grade: S/A/B/C/D. | The emotional climax. The player sees their decade in a 3-5 minute sequence that is unique to their playthrough. |

**Breadcrumbing Strategy**:

- **Mobile Strategy Question**: The board's mobile question is phrased as optional: "The board requests your perspective on mobile gaming opportunities." Unlike the Wii mandate in Year 4, this is not a demand. It's a test of character. Does the player chase the next disruption, or do they stay true to the identity they built? Both paths are valid. The breadcrumb is the phrasing: "requests," not "demands."
- **Voss Email Trigger**: If Eleanor Voss has not yet sent her email (contingent on player portfolio), it arrives in Year 9 or early Year 10. The email is flagged with a unique icon (a personal letter, not a corporate memo). The breadcrumb: this is important. This is not a milestone review. This is a human being speaking to you directly. Read it.
- **Final Greenlight Emotional Weight**: The final greenlight cycle (Year 10 Q1-Q2) has unique UI framing. The screen title reads: "Final Greenlight Cycle -- Year 10." The greenlight stamp, when used, has a slightly longer animation -- a half-second pause before it lands. The breadcrumb: the game is giving you a moment to feel the weight of this being the last time. Every greenlight has felt important. This one feels final.
- **Montage Foreshadowing**: Loading screens in Year 10 reference the player's history: "In 2004, you greenlit Project Falcon. It scored 88 and sold 1.2M copies." "In 2007, Cathedral Studios left Stonebridge after trust dropped below -15." The breadcrumb: the game is preparing you for the montage. It is reminding you that everything you did is recorded. The legacy is not abstract. It is specific, and the game will show you every piece.

**Difficulty Considerations**:

- **No Safety Net**: Years 9-10 are the only campaign section where the board will terminate the player after a single bad year (not two consecutive). If Board_Satisfaction drops below 50 in Year 9, the player receives a "final warning." If it drops below 50 again in Year 10, termination occurs before the Legacy Montage. This is harsh but thematic: the final years demand excellence.
- **High-Variance Outcomes**: Late-game projects (especially Magnum Opus bets from Years 5-7) have wider quality variance than early-game projects. The player has less control. This is intentional. The late game tests whether the player can handle outcomes they cannot fully engineer. Faith vs. control.
- **Studio Closure Wave**: The industry consolidation in Year 10 Q3 causes 1-2 studios in the pitch pool to close or be acquired by rivals, regardless of the player's relationship with them. This is systemic, not personal. The player learns that they cannot save everyone. Some things happen outside their control. This is a thematic beat disguised as a difficulty spike.

**Playtesting Metrics**:

- **Completion Rate**: What % of players who reach Year 9 complete the campaign? Target: 85-90%. Drop-off in the final two years suggests pacing sag or fatigue. Track session length in Y9-10. If sessions are shorter than Y7-8, engagement is declining (needs tightening).
- **Final Greenlight Choices**: In the final greenlight cycle (Y10 Q1-Q2), what % of players choose safe sequels vs. risky new IP? Track correlation with Legacy Grade outcomes. Do players who take risks get rewarded narratively (higher Patron Score) even if Profit suffers? They should.
- **Termination Rate in Final Years**: What % of players are fired in Year 9 or Year 10? Target: under 10%. The final years should be hard but not punitive. If termination rate exceeds 15%, the difficulty spike is too sharp (reduce board sensitivity or provide more catch-up tools).
- **Legacy Montage Engagement**: Track how many players skip the final montage (if skip is enabled). Target: under 5% skip rate. If skip rate exceeds 15%, the montage is too long or not emotionally resonant (needs editing).

## 3. SPATIAL DESIGN: THE UI AS LEVEL ARCHITECTURE

This game has no 3D space, but it has architecture. Every screen is a room. Every transition is a corridor. The player MOVES through this architecture, and the architecture guides their attention.

### 3.1 The Greenlight Table (Core Arena)

**Purpose**: This is the boss room. Every greenlight decision happens here. The table must feel ceremonial, weighty, irreversible.

**Sightline Design**:
- **Primary Focus**: The pitch dossier. Center screen. Largest UI element. Player's eyes land here first.
- **Secondary Focus**: The studio representative's portrait. Top-left. Eye contact. The face of the person whose fate you are deciding.
- **Tertiary Focus**: The greenlight stamp. Bottom-center. Glowing green ring. Always visible but never intrusive. The tool waits for you.
- **Peripheral Info**: Budget ticker (top-right), available slots (top-right), portfolio snapshot (sidebar, collapsible). These are in peripheral vision unless the player actively seeks them.

**Flow Path**:
```
Player enters Greenlight Table
    |
    v
Eyes land on pitch dossier (auto-scroll to Gut-Feel and Market Fit -- the headlines)
    |
    v
Player reads details (Studio profile, budget, timeline, risk flags -- in that order, top to bottom)
    |
    v
Player glances at studio portrait (Are they confident? Desperate? Defensive?)
    |
    v
Player checks portfolio sidebar (Do I need Prestige? Profit? Populism?)
    |
    v
Player checks budget ticker (Can I afford this?)
    |
    v
Decision crystallizes
    |
    v
Player clicks greenlight stamp OR pass button
    |
    v
Stamp animation (1.5 seconds, unskippable on first greenlight)
    |
    v
Studio reacts (portrait changes, email preview appears)
    |
    v
Pitch slides away, next pitch appears OR return to quarterly hub
```

**Breadcrumbing**:
- **Glowing Elements**: The first time the player enters the Greenlight Table, the Gut-Feel Indicator has a subtle pulse. The game is saying: "Look here first."
- **Hover Tooltips**: Hovering over risk flags or market fit scores reveals additional context. "Risk: Unproven Genre -- this studio has never made a game like this before." The tooltip is the breadcrumb toward deeper evaluation.
- **Stamp Placement**: The greenlight stamp is bottom-center, requiring a deliberate downward movement of the mouse/cursor. The player must REACH for it. This is not an accidental click. The physical (or cursor-based) distance between the dossier and the stamp is the moment of hesitation.

### 3.2 The Milestone Review Screen (Management Arena)

**Purpose**: Where the player manages active projects. Must support quick triage (most projects are "on track") while highlighting crisis moments (budget overruns, morale collapses).

**Sightline Design**:
- **Primary Focus**: Project cards in a horizontal row. Each card is color-coded: green (on track), amber (needs attention), red (crisis).
- **Secondary Focus**: The amber and red cards are slightly larger and pulse. The eye is drawn to problems first.
- **Tertiary Focus**: Intervention menu (appears when a project is selected). Grid of 15-20 intervention buttons. The "Restraint" option is top-left, highlighted in neutral blue. All other interventions are in a secondary visual hierarchy.

**Flow Path**:
```
Player enters Milestone Review phase
    |
    v
Eyes scan the project cards (green, green, amber, red)
    |
    v
Player clicks the red card (crisis prioritization)
    |
    v
Detailed report appears: morale bar (red zone), budget status (overrun), narrative snippet from studio
    |
    v
Player evaluates: intervention or restraint?
    |
    v
Player selects intervention OR selects "Restraint" (do nothing)
    |
    v
Confirmation popup: "This will cost $X and affect morale by -Y. Confirm?"
    |
    v
Player confirms
    |
    v
Project card updates (morale bar shifts, budget ticker changes, studio reaction snippet)
    |
    v
Next project OR return to quarterly hub
```

**Breadcrumbing**:
- **Crisis Cards Pulse**: Red cards have a slow, rhythmic pulse. The game is saying: "Deal with this first."
- **Restraint is Default-Highlighted**: When the player selects a green card (on track project), the intervention menu appears but the "Restraint" button is pre-highlighted. The default action is to do nothing. The player must actively choose to intervene on a healthy project. This trains the restraint instinct.
- **Narrative Snippets**: Each milestone report includes a 1-2 sentence quote from the studio. "The team is exhausted but excited. Morale is holding." vs. "Lead designer sent a terse email: 'We'll add the multiplayer. But this isn't what we pitched.'" The narrative snippet is the emotional breadcrumb that tells the player what the numbers mean.

### 3.3 The Board Room (Judgment Arena)

**Purpose**: Where the player is evaluated. Must feel formal, sterile, and slightly hostile. The player is on trial.

**Sightline Design**:
- **Primary Focus**: The Portfolio Matrix triangle. Center screen. Large. Each axis glows green (above target) or red (below target).
- **Secondary Focus**: Board members' portraits arrayed around the screen edges. Formal headshots. No expressions. Corporate homogeneity.
- **Tertiary Focus**: Scrolling text of board assessment. Bullet points. Bolded performance metrics. Clinical language.

**Flow Path**:
```
Quarterly or Annual Board Review begins
    |
    v
Screen transition: fade to boardroom (mahogany table, projector screen)
    |
    v
Portfolio Matrix appears, animates to current values
    |
    v
Each axis pulses green or red
    |
    v
Board assessment text scrolls (unskippable, but fast enough to not bore)
    |
    v
Board delivers verdict: "Satisfactory" / "Concerning" / "Exceptional" / "Unacceptable"
    |
    v
If warning issued: specific axis targets highlighted for next review
    |
    v
Player clicks "Acknowledge" -> return to quarterly hub
```

**Breadcrumbing**:
- **Axis Targets Visible**: Before the board review, the quarterly hub shows the upcoming board targets in a subtle sidebar. "Year 5 Targets: P1 > 45, P2 > 50, P3 > 45." The breadcrumb: you know what's coming. You have quarters to prepare.
- **Board Member Eleanor Voss**: One of the board portraits is Eleanor Voss. She never speaks in board reviews (the text is collective "The Board..."). But her portrait is visually distinct -- older, warmer, the only one not wearing a suit. The breadcrumb: she is here. She is watching. If the player notices her, they start looking for her email.
- **Historical Comparison**: The board assessment includes a line: "Compared to Q4 2006, Prestige is up 12 points, Profit is down 8 points." The breadcrumb: the game is tracking your trajectory, not just your current state. Growth and decline matter.

### 3.4 The Inbox (Emotional Hub)

**Purpose**: Where human voices reach the player. Must feel personal, overwhelming, and impossible to fully process. The inbox is where the distance between the player and the studios is smallest.

**Sightline Design**:
- **Primary Focus**: Unread email count. Top-right, glowing amber if unread > 5, glowing red if unread > 10.
- **Secondary Focus**: Email list. Subject lines visible. Sender names visible. Preview text (first line of email body).
- **Tertiary Focus**: Selected email body. Center screen. Scrollable if long. Sender portrait at top.

**Flow Path**:
```
Player accesses inbox (optional, can be skipped)
    |
    v
Email list appears, sorted by date (newest first)
    |
    v
Unread emails are bolded
    |
    v
Player clicks an email
    |
    v
Email body appears. Player reads.
    |
    v
Player clicks "Close" OR "Reply" (if reply templates are implemented)
    |
    v
Next email OR return to quarterly hub
```

**Breadcrumbing**:
- **Subject Line Emotional Weight**: Subject lines are written to convey urgency or emotion. "RE: Milestone Review -- concerns" vs. "THANK YOU" vs. "We need to talk." The breadcrumb: you can triage by subject line, but the most important emails are often the ones with the quietest subject lines.
- **Sender Portraits**: Emails from studio heads include their portrait. The portrait's expression reflects the email's tone. A smiling Sato after a successful milestone. A grim Victor after a forced intervention. The breadcrumb: the face tells you how to feel before you read the words.
- **Unread Badge Pressure**: The unread count never goes away unless the player actively reads or marks as read. The game does not punish ignoring emails mechanically, but the glowing badge is a constant, subtle pressure. The breadcrumb: you can ignore this. But it will always be there.

## 4. ENCOUNTER DESIGN: THE FIVE ARCHETYPES OF TENSION

Every quarter contains one or more "encounters" -- moments that demand the player's attention and decision-making. These encounters fall into five archetypes, and the pacing of the campaign is built around their distribution.

### 4.1 Encounter Archetype: THE GREENLIGHT DILEMMA

**Definition**: Multiple good pitches, insufficient slots. The player must choose which dreams live.

**When It Appears**: Every greenlight cycle. Frequency: 4 per year minimum.

**Tension Source**: Opportunity cost. Saying yes to one pitch is saying no to another.

**Resolution**: Player stamps greenlight on 1-2 pitches, passes on the rest.

**Pacing Use**: This is the baseline encounter. It appears regularly and establishes rhythm. The difficulty scales by increasing the number of good pitches relative to available slots.

**Example**:
- Year 2 Q2: 4 pitches, 2 slots. Two pitches are clearly strong. One is a safe sequel (Profit). One is a risky original IP (Prestige). The player cannot have both. The board wants Profit. The player's instinct (and Voss's legacy) whispers Prestige.

### 4.2 Encounter Archetype: THE INTERVENTION CRISIS

**Definition**: A project is failing. Morale is collapsing, budget is bleeding, or quality is tanking. The player must intervene or cut losses.

**When It Appears**: 2-3 times per year in early game, 4-6 times per year in late game.

**Tension Source**: Sunk cost. The player has already invested. Cancelling feels like failure. Doubling down feels like gambling.

**Resolution**: Player selects an intervention (with cost and morale impact) OR cancels the project (kill fee, studio trust damage).

**Pacing Use**: Spikes of high tension. These encounters break the rhythm of the greenlight cycle and force reactive decision-making.

**Example**:
- Year 4 Q2: A next-gen project greenlit in Year 3 is 40% over budget and morale is at 22. The studio head sends a desperate email: "We underestimated next-gen complexity. We need six more months and $10M, or this ships broken." The player must choose: Expand Scope (expensive, high risk), Ship Early (cheap, guarantees a bad game), or Cancel (lose $18M, destroy studio relationship, board will notice).

### 4.3 Encounter Archetype: THE ERA DISRUPTION

**Definition**: A systemic event reshapes the market. The player's existing strategy is suddenly suboptimal.

**When It Appears**: 4-6 times across the campaign. Major events: Xbox 360 launch (Y3), Wii launch (Y4), DLC economy (Y6), Recession (Y6), Mobile (Y9).

**Tension Source**: Forced adaptation. The player built a strategy, and the world just changed the rules.

**Resolution**: Player adapts (greenlight new types of projects, shift budget allocation) OR resists (double down on existing strategy, accept penalties).

**Pacing Use**: Act breaks. Era disruptions mark the transitions between campaign phases. They destabilize mastery and force the player to re-learn.

**Example**:
- Year 4 Q4: Wii launches. Install base explodes. Board demands a casual gaming strategy. The player has zero Wii projects in development. The next greenlight cycle will include Wii pitches, but greenlighting them means sacrificing a core gaming project slot. The player's identity (core vs. casual) is tested.

### 4.4 Encounter Archetype: THE STUDIO RELATIONSHIP TEST

**Definition**: A studio the player has history with makes a request, delivers a surprise, or faces a crisis. The player's response shapes the relationship permanently.

**When It Appears**: 3-5 times per year, increasing in frequency as relationships deepen.

**Tension Source**: Loyalty vs. pragmatism. The player has invested in this studio. The studio is asking for something costly or risky. Do you protect the relationship or protect the portfolio?

**Resolution**: Player honors the studio's request (cost, morale gain, trust gain) OR refuses (saves cost, morale loss, trust loss).

**Pacing Use**: Emotional peaks. These encounters personalize the systemic decisions and give the player a reason to care beyond the numbers.

**Example**:
- Year 6 Q3: Cathedral Studios (Sato) emails: "The game is done. But it's not done. I need three more months to get the lighting right. It's the difference between an 85 and a 92. I know the board wants it shipped for holiday. I'm asking you to delay it. I won't ask again." The player must choose: Delay to Polish (miss holiday window, lower revenue, higher quality, trust +15) OR force Ship Early (hit holiday, morale -25, trust -20, quality locked at current state).

### 4.5 Encounter Archetype: THE BOARD JUDGMENT

**Definition**: The board evaluates the player's performance and delivers consequences. Targets are met or missed. The publisher's future is shaped.

**When It Appears**: 4 per year (quarterly reviews) + 1 annual evaluation. Escalates in severity each year.

**Tension Source**: Delayed consequences. The player's decisions from months ago are being judged now. The outcomes are visible but the judgment is uncertain.

**Resolution**: Board delivers verdict. If satisfactory, budget may increase or new opportunities unlock. If unsatisfactory, warnings issued or penalties applied (budget cuts, slot reductions, termination threat).

**Pacing Use**: Act-end climaxes. Board judgments mark the end of a cycle and set the stakes for the next. The annual evaluation is the emotional low point (vulnerability) followed by the next year's opening (renewed possibility).

**Example**:
- Year 8 Q4: Annual Board Review. The player hit Prestige > 70 (target met) but Profit is at 48 (target: 55). Board delivers: "Satisfactory performance in prestige objectives. However, profitability concerns persist. Shareholders are asking questions. We expect Profit above 55 by end of Year 9, or budget will be reduced by 20%." The player has four quarters to fix Profit or face a crippling penalty.

---

## 5. PACING ACROSS TIMESCALES: THE NESTED LOOP STRUCTURE

GREENLIGHT operates on three pacing timescales simultaneously. Each must feel distinct, and they must nest inside each other without creating repetition fatigue.

### 5.1 The Quarterly Loop (15-20 minutes)

**Structure**:
1. **Greenlight Phase** (5-7 min): Evaluate 3-5 pitches. Greenlight 1-2.
2. **Management Phase** (4-6 min): Review 2-4 active projects. Intervene or restrain.
3. **Era Event Phase** (1-2 min): Industry news, market shifts, random events.
4. **Results Phase** (2-4 min): Games ship (if any). Metacritic scores land. Studio reactions arrive.
5. **Transition** (1 min): Quarter summary. Next quarter begins.

**Pacing Feel**: Brisk but not rushed. The player should feel engaged but not overwhelmed. Each phase has a clear purpose and a clear end. The loop is short enough to encourage "one more quarter" behavior.

**Tension Curve Within a Quarter**:
```
    ^
    |
    |     *****  (Management Phase)
    | ****     *****
    |*              *** (Results Phase)
    +-------------------> Time
    Greenlight  Mgmt  Event  Results
```

**Variance**: Some quarters are quiet (all projects on track, no major events, no ships). Some quarters are explosive (multiple ships, era disruption, crisis intervention needed). The variance prevents monotony. Quiet quarters are breathers. Explosive quarters are sprints.

### 5.2 The Annual Loop (45-90 minutes)

**Structure**:
1. **Q1-Q3**: Greenlight cycles, milestone management, era events, ships.
2. **Q3**: E3 Showcase (special event, appears in place of or alongside normal quarterly flow).
3. **Q4**: Final greenlight cycle of the year + Annual Board Review (longer, more detailed than quarterly reviews).

**Pacing Feel**: The year builds toward Q4. The first three quarters feel like setup. Q4 feels like reckoning. The annual review is the emotional climax of the year -- the moment the player sees the full picture of what they built and how the board judges it.

**Tension Curve Across a Year**:
```
    ^
    |
    |                       **********  (Q4 Annual Review)
    |               ********
    |       ********
    +-------*-----------------------------> Quarter
    Q1      Q2      Q3 (E3)      Q4
```

**Variance**: Early years (1-3) have gentle slopes. Late years (7-10) have steep ramps. The annual review in Year 1 is a pat on the back. The annual review in Year 9 is a judgment that feels existential.

### 5.3 The Campaign Arc (12-18 hours)

**Structure**:
- **Act One (Years 1-3, ~4-6 hours)**: Learning. Gentle slope. Building confidence.
- **Act Two (Years 4-7, ~6-9 hours)**: Disruption. Steep slope. Testing everything.
- **Act Three (Years 8-10, ~4-6 hours)**: Mastery and reckoning. High complexity, emotional payoff.

**Pacing Feel**: The campaign is a slow burn that accelerates. The player should feel like they are building something across years, and the pace should reflect that accumulation. The final years should feel both earned and inevitable -- the player has been building toward this legacy montage for 15 hours, and when it arrives, it must feel like the only possible ending.

**Tension Curve Across the Campaign**:
```
    ^
    |
    |                               *******  (Legacy Montage)
    |                           ****
    |                   ********
    |       ************
    +-------*-------------------------------*> Year
    Y1      Y3      Y5      Y7      Y9      Y10
 (Inherit)      (Disrupt) (Crisis)  (Identity) (Reckoning)
```

**Pacing Risks**:
- **Mid-game sag (Years 5-6)**: The danger zone. The player has mastered the core loop but the campaign is not yet climactic. Mitigation: Era disruptions (DLC, recession) and studio relationship payoffs (Magnum Opus offers) provide new spikes of tension.
- **Late-game fatigue (Years 9-10)**: If the player feels like they are repeating the same loop without new inputs, engagement drops. Mitigation: The mobile disruption (optional pivot), studio closures (forced losses), and the final greenlight cycle (emotional framing) provide novelty and finality.

## 6. DIFFICULTY VARIANTS AND ACCESSIBILITY

### 6.1 Core Difficulty Modes

GREENLIGHT should support three difficulty modes that affect systemic parameters without changing the core loop:

**PATRON MODE (Story Focus)**
- Board targets reduced by 15%.
- Studio morale more forgiving (interventions cost 30% less morale).
- Gut-Feel Indicator more accurate (noise reduced by 40%).
- Quality_Seed variance tightened (fewer catastrophic failures, fewer surprise masterpieces).
- **Purpose**: Let players focus on studio relationships and narrative without intense optimization pressure. The story of the studios is the main attraction.

**EXECUTIVE MODE (Standard)**
- Default balance. All systems as designed.
- **Purpose**: The intended experience. Challenge without punishment. Failure is possible but recovery is achievable.

**MOGUL MODE (High Challenge)**
- Board targets increased by 20%.
- Budget reduced by 10% each year.
- Studio morale more volatile (interventions cost 50% more morale).
- Era events hit harder (disruptions have stronger systemic effects).
- No Intuition stat improvement (Gut-Feel remains noisy throughout).
- **Purpose**: For players who want to optimize, min-max, and sweat. The systemic challenge is the main attraction.

### 6.2 Accessibility Features (Non-Difficulty)

- **Decision Timer Toggle**: Optional. Adds a visible 30-second countdown per greenlight decision. For players who want to feel time pressure. Default: OFF.
- **Notification Density**: Options for reducing background emails, news tickers, and flavor events. Some players want maximum immersion; others want signal-only.
- **Colorblind Modes**: Portfolio Matrix uses shapes + color. Morale bars use patterns + color. All status indicators have non-color redundancy.
- **Text Size Scaling**: The game is text-heavy. UI must support 125% and 150% text scaling without breaking layouts.
- **Auto-Pause on Milestone Reviews**: Optional. Pauses the quarterly flow when a milestone review appears, allowing the player to take their time. Default: ON.

## 7. PLAYTESTING PRIORITIES: LEVEL DESIGN METRICS

These metrics are specific to flow, pacing, and attention design. They complement REED's mechanical playtesting priorities.

### 7.1 Flow Metrics

**Greenlight Decision Time**
- **Track**: Time from pitch appearing to decision made.
- **Target**: 20-40 seconds per pitch (average across all players).
- **Red Flags**: If under 10 seconds, players are not reading. If over 90 seconds, information overload or decision paralysis.

**Milestone Review Engagement**
- **Track**: % of milestone reviews where the player changes the default camera focus (i.e., they actively inspect the project vs. quick-confirming "On Track" status).
- **Target**: 60-70% engagement (most reviews are read, but not all demand deep focus).
- **Red Flags**: If under 40%, players are skipping content. If over 90%, every review feels mandatory (should have more "on track" quick-confirms).

**Inbox Open Rate**
- **Track**: % of quarters where the player opens the inbox at least once.
- **Target**: 50-60% (the inbox is optional but frequently visited).
- **Red Flags**: If under 30%, emails are not compelling. If over 85%, the inbox feels mandatory (some players should be able to ignore it without penalty).

### 7.2 Pacing Metrics

**Quarterly Completion Time**
- **Track**: Real-world time to complete one quarter (from start of greenlight phase to transition to next quarter).
- **Target**: 12-18 minutes (average). Quiet quarters: 10-12 min. Explosive quarters: 18-25 min.
- **Red Flags**: If average exceeds 25 minutes, the quarterly loop is too slow (fatigue risk). If under 10 minutes, the loop is too shallow (no depth).

**Session Length**
- **Track**: How long do players play in a single session?
- **Target**: 45-90 minutes (covering 3-5 quarters).
- **Red Flags**: If sessions average under 30 minutes, the loop is not engaging enough for "one more quarter" behavior. If sessions average over 120 minutes without breaks, pacing may be creating compulsion rather than enjoyment.

**Drop-Off Points**
- **Track**: At what year/quarter do players stop playing (for players who do not complete the campaign)?
- **Target**: Drop-off should be minimal (<15%) and distributed evenly across the campaign (no single "wall" where everyone quits).
- **Red Flags**: If 30%+ of players quit in Years 5-6, mid-game sag confirmed. If 20%+ quit in Year 1, onboarding is failing.

### 7.3 Attention Metrics

**Hover/Tooltip Interaction Rate**
- **Track**: How often do players hover over UI elements to reveal tooltips?
- **Target**: 3-5 tooltips viewed per greenlight decision (on average, early game). Declines to 1-2 per decision in late game (as players internalize the systems).
- **Red Flags**: If tooltip usage is under 1 per decision, critical information is not discoverable. If over 8 per decision, the UI is hiding too much behind tooltips.

**Portfolio Matrix Glance Frequency**
- **Track**: How many times per quarter does the player open the Portfolio Matrix summary?
- **Target**: 1-2 times per quarter (before greenlight decisions, after ships).
- **Red Flags**: If under 0.5 times per quarter, the Portfolio Matrix is not driving strategy. If over 4 times per quarter, players are obsessively checking (anxiety, not engagement).

**Studio Profile Inspection Rate**
- **Track**: When evaluating a pitch, how often does the player click to view the full studio profile (vs. making a decision based on pitch dossier alone)?
- **Target**: 40-60% of pitches (players dig deeper on ambiguous or high-stakes decisions).
- **Red Flags**: If under 20%, studio profiles are not adding value. If over 80%, the pitch dossier does not provide enough info on its own.

## 8. TEACHING WITHOUT TUTORIALS: THE BREADCRUMB PHILOSOPHY

GREENLIGHT does not have a traditional tutorial sequence. The game teaches through breadcrumbs -- UI cues, narrative framing, and systemic feedback that guide the player toward mastery without explicit instruction.

### 8.1 Breadcrumb Principles

**1. Show, Don't Tell**
- The first greenlight decision is not preceded by a text box explaining how greenlights work. It is preceded by a pitch sitting on the table and a glowing stamp waiting to be used. The player learns by doing.

**2. Highlight the Next Action**
- When a new system unlocks (e.g., the Intervention System in Q2 of Year 1), the relevant UI element pulses gently. The game says: "Look here next."

**3. Consequences Teach**
- The player learns that studios remember their decisions because a studio they treated poorly sends a cold email three quarters later. The system does not announce "Studios have memory." The player discovers it through experience.

**4. Redundancy in Feedback**
- Every important outcome is communicated in multiple ways. A game's Metacritic score appears in: (1) a news ticker, (2) an email from the studio, (3) the Portfolio Matrix update, (4) the board review. The player cannot miss it.

**5. Optional Depth**
- Critical information is always visible. Deep information is discoverable. A player can greenlight based on Gut-Feel and Market Fit alone. A player who wants to optimize can dig into studio profiles, archived emails, and historical performance data. Both play styles are supported.

### 8.2 Teaching Sequence (Year 1 Q1-Q4)

**Q1: The Kill Order**
- **What the Player Learns**: Decisions have consequences. Greenlighting is not free. Mercy costs budget. Cruelty costs trust.
- **How It's Taught**: Two buttons. No tutorial text. The pitch document describes the project's troubled state. The studio's email begs for time. The board's memo demands cancellation. The player chooses. The outcome arrives in Q2-Q3 (the project either ships or collapses, validating or punishing the player's choice).

**Q1: First Greenlight Table**
- **What the Player Learns**: Evaluate pitches. Stamp greenlights. Some pitches are better than others. You cannot fund everything.
- **How It's Taught**: 3 pitches, 2 slots. The pitch dossiers have visual hierarchy (Gut-Feel and Market Fit are the largest elements). One pitch is clearly strong (all green indicators). One pitch is clearly weak (all amber/red indicators). One pitch is ambiguous. The player learns: green = good, red = bad, amber = guess.

**Q2: First Milestone Review**
- **What the Player Learns**: Projects need management. Intervention is possible. Restraint is also possible. Every action has a cost.
- **How It's Taught**: One active project hits a milestone. The milestone report appears. The intervention menu unlocks with a tooltip: "You can intervene or choose restraint." The "Restraint" button is pre-highlighted. The tooltip for "Restraint" reads: "Do nothing. Studio morale +3. Sometimes trust is the best intervention."

**Q3: E3 Showcase**
- **What the Player Learns**: Not all marketing is equal. Showcase slots are limited. You must choose which games get spotlight.
- **How It's Taught**: E3 event appears. The player has 2-3 active projects but only 1-2 showcase slots. Each project has a "showcase recommendation" rating based on current build quality and market buzz. The player chooses. In Q4, showcased games receive a marketing bonus (visible in the Populism delta when they ship).

**Q4: First Ship + Board Review**
- **What the Player Learns**: Outcomes arrive months after decisions. Metacritic matters. The board judges your portfolio, not individual games. Portfolio Matrix is introduced.
- **How It's Taught**: A game greenlit in Q1 ships in Q4. Metacritic score appears as a news article with pull quotes. Studio sends an email reacting to the score (grateful if high, wounded if low). Board review appears with the Portfolio Matrix for the first time. Each axis has a tooltip explaining what it measures and how the shipped game affected it.

By end of Year 1, the player understands:
- How to greenlight (Q1)
- How to manage (Q2)
- How to market (Q3)
- How outcomes arrive and are judged (Q4)

No tutorial text. No hand-holding. Just breadcrumbs, consequences, and systemic feedback.

## 9. RISK ASSESSMENT: LEVEL DESIGN FAILURE MODES

### What Could Make the Flow Unfun

**Risk 1: Quarterly Loop Becomes Repetitive**
- **Symptom**: "Every quarter feels the same. I'm just clicking through."
- **Cause**: Insufficient variance in encounter types. Too many "on track" milestone reviews. Not enough era events or studio relationship moments.
- **Mitigation**: Ensure that 40-50% of quarters contain at least one high-variance event (crisis intervention, studio relationship test, era disruption, or ship with surprising outcome). The other 50-60% are baseline flow, but the player should never go more than 2 consecutive quarters without something unexpected.

**Risk 2: Greenlight Table Becomes Decision Fatigue**
- **Symptom**: "I don't care about these pitches anymore. I just want to move on."
- **Cause**: Too many pitches per cycle, or pitches that feel interchangeable.
- **Mitigation**: Cap pitches at 5 per cycle maximum. Ensure that each pitch has a distinct "hook" -- a narrative snippet, a unique studio personality, or a clear strategic angle. No two pitches should feel like palette swaps.

**Risk 3: Milestone Review Phase Feels Like Homework**
- **Symptom**: "I have to review six projects and I don't care about any of them."
- **Cause**: Too many active projects, or projects that demand deep attention every quarter.
- **Mitigation**: Most milestone reviews should be quick-confirms ("On Track -- morale 75, budget stable -- no action needed"). Only 1-2 projects per quarter should demand deep evaluation. If the player has 6 active projects, 4 should be green (quick-confirm) and 2 should be amber/red (require attention).

**Risk 4: Board Reviews Feel Arbitrary**
- **Symptom**: "I don't understand why my Prestige dropped. The board is punishing me for things I can't control."
- **Cause**: Opaque Portfolio Matrix calculations or lack of attribution.
- **Mitigation**: Every axis change must be attributed to a specific game or event. "Project Titan (Metacritic 91) -> Prestige +18. Project Falcon (Metacritic 68) -> Prestige -5." The player should always be able to answer: "Why did this axis move?"

**Risk 5: Era Disruptions Feel Like Punishments, Not Opportunities**
- **Symptom**: "The Wii just ruined my entire strategy and I can't recover."
- **Cause**: Disruptions are not telegraphed, or the player has no tools to adapt.
- **Mitigation**: All major era disruptions are telegraphed 1-2 quarters in advance via news tickers. After the disruption hits, the pitch pool immediately includes opportunities that align with the new conditions. The game is saying: "The world changed. Here are your new tools. Will you use them?"

**Risk 6: The Campaign Is Too Long**
- **Symptom**: "I'm in Year 6 and I'm bored. I get the systems. I don't need four more years."
- **Cause**: Mid-game sag. No new mechanics introduced, and the existing loop feels solved.
- **Mitigation**: The pacing schedule introduces new systems through Year 7 (DLC, recession, studio acquisition). If playtesting reveals persistent drop-off in Years 5-7, consider compressing the campaign to 8 years (cutting Years 5-6 into a single year). Quality over quantity.

**Risk 7: Studio Relationships Feel Mechanical, Not Emotional**
- **Symptom**: "I'm just optimizing trust scores. I don't care about these studios as characters."
- **Cause**: Studios communicate through data (morale bars, trust numbers) without enough narrative personality.
- **Mitigation**: Every trust and morale change must be accompanied by a narrative snippet. A studio whose trust drops from +10 to +5 sends an email: "We delivered on time, but the revisions you demanded felt like you didn't believe in our vision. We're still committed. But it stings." The number changes, but the player feels it through the voice.

## 10. FINAL THOUGHTS: LEVEL DESIGN AS EMOTIONAL ARCHITECTURE

A level is not geometry. A level is a sequence of choices presented in a space designed to guide the player's attention toward the next meaningful decision.

GREENLIGHT is a game about decisions, which means every quarter is a level. Every year is a dungeon. The campaign is a 10-year descent into the weight of power, with the Legacy Montage as the boss fight -- not against an enemy, but against the accumulated consequences of every choice the player made when no one was watching.

Where does the player LOOK? At faces. At numbers. At emails. At the greenlight stamp waiting at the bottom of the screen.

Where does the player MOVE? Through time. Through consequence. Through relationships that grow or break based on whether they chose restraint or control.

What's the breadcrumb? It's the glowing UI element that says "Look here." It's the studio email that arrives three quarters late and references a decision the player forgot they made. It's the board review that highlights the axis you've been ignoring. It's Eleanor Voss's portrait in the board room, silent for nine years, waiting for the player to notice.

The pacing curve is the shape of regret delayed. Early game: no consequences yet, just potential. Mid-game: consequences arrive, compounding. Late game: consequences are your entire world, and the only thing left is to see the shape of what you built.

Every room teaches something. Every corridor is pacing. Every vista is a reward.

GREENLIGHT has no corridors. But it has quarters.
GREENLIGHT has no vistas. But it has the Legacy Montage.
GREENLIGHT has no jump arcs. But it has the moment between reading a pitch and bringing the stamp down, and in that moment lives the entire game.

That's level design.

**END OF DOCUMENT**

*-- GRID, Level Designer*
*"Where does the player LOOK? That's the first question. The last question is: did they see what you wanted them to see, or did they see something deeper?"*
