## 1. THE HOOK (Three Versions)

### One Sentence

**You don't make games — you decide which games get made, and every greenlight shapes an industry you can't fully control.**

### One Paragraph

You're a game publisher executive in the mid-2000s. AI studios pitch you games. You decide who gets funded, who gets cancelled, and who gets a sequel. Every greenlight is a bet — on talent, on trends, on yourself. The auteur's passion project and the sequel factory's cash cow are competing for the same funding round. You can't have both. Your greenlights from Year 1 are still paying dividends (or debts) in Year 5. This is not a game about making games. This is a game about being the person who says yes or no to someone else's creative vision — and living with that weight for a decade.

### One Page (The Scroll-Stop Pitch)

**The GIF that sells this game:**

You're in a greenlight meeting. Three studios are pitching. The first is a slick PowerPoint from a sequel factory — guaranteed 80 Metacritic, 200M revenue, zero surprises. The second is a shaky webcam pitch from a three-person indie team with an idea so weird you can't stop thinking about it. The third is a legendary auteur studio that burned through their last publisher's money and got fired — they're begging for a second chance with a game that sounds either genius or delusional.

You fund the auteur. Six months later, the milestone review lands on your desk. They've built a revolutionary physics engine but forgot to make a main menu. Morale is high but the budget is bleeding. E3 is in four months. Do you intervene? Do you trust the vision? Do you demand they cut the procedural weather system and ship the damn game?

That decision screen — three studios, three gambles, your signature on the check — is the GIF. The consequences that ripple across years of in-game time are the hook that keeps people playing until 3 AM.

**What makes GREENLIGHT different:**

There are games about MAKING games. There has never been a game about FUNDING games. You are not the developer. You are the person who decides which developers get to exist. You never get to play the games you greenlight — you only see milestone builds, focus group reports, and Metacritic scores. You are powerful and impotent at the same time. You hold the money, but you cannot make the game for them. The distance between your power and your control is where this game's entire emotional core lives.

**The nostalgia hook:**

The game simulates the 2003-2012 era — Xbox 360 launch, Wii disruption, rise of digital distribution, DLC economy, Metacritic's growing influence. If you lived through this era of gaming, you will feel it in your bones. If you didn't, you will learn why this decade defined everything that came after. The era is not backdrop. It is a core system. The Wii launches whether or not you have a casual game in development. Digital distribution emerges whether or not you're ready. You adapt or you drown.

**The emotional hook:**

By year 5, you will care about studios by name. You will hesitate before cancelling a project because you remember the email the studio head sent you when you believed in them three years ago. You will feel the specific, unnameable emotion of seeing a decade of small decisions become a legacy. Not pride, exactly. Not regret. Something in between. The feeling of having mattered to things that mattered to other people.

## 2. TARGET AUDIENCE

### Primary Audience (The Day-One Buyers)

**Demographic**: Ages 25-40, PC gamers, management sim enthusiasts, people who work in or adjacent to creative industries.

**Psychographic**: They play Game Dev Tycoon, Two Point Hospital, Planet Coaster — but they wish those games were deeper and more emotionally resonant. They've read *Blood, Sweat, and Pixels*. They follow Jason Schreier. They have opinions about the game industry. They know the feeling of pitching something they believe in to someone who controls the budget. They hang out on r/Games, r/gamedev, r/tycoon, and ResetEra.

**What hooks them**: "If Game Dev Tycoon met Crusader Kings." The promise of systemic depth married to human consequence. They want a management sim that makes them FEEL something beyond optimization.

**Messaging**: Emphasize the publisher fantasy ("You've made games. Now decide which ones deserve to exist."), the studio relationship web (persistent AI entities with memory and grudges), and the era engine (historical industry forces as strategic systems).

**Platform**: PC/Steam primary. This audience lives on Steam. They browse Steam curated lists, follow Steam Next Fest, and wishlist games 12 months in advance.

### Secondary Audience (The Word-of-Mouth Multipliers)

**Demographic**: Ages 20-35, strategy and simulation players who love systemic depth.

**Psychographic**: The Crusader Kings, Dwarf Fortress, RimWorld crowd. They optimize. They min-max. They play 200-hour campaigns. They will discover the Studio Relationship Web and the Era Engine and reverse-engineer the formulas to build the perfect publisher.

**What hooks them**: Emergent stories. The reputation cascade where cancelling one game destroys your relationship with an entire studio archetype. The counter-cycle play where you greenlight ambitious projects during the 2008 recession at reduced rates and position them to ship in 2010 when the market recovers. They want a simulation rich enough to break in interesting ways.

**Messaging**: "A simulation so systemically rich that every playthrough generates unique stories." Emphasize the franchise snowball, the morale death spiral, the trust compound. Show them the systems, and they will obsess.

**Platform**: PC/Steam primary. This audience doesn't care about graphics. They care about depth.

### Tertiary Audience (The Cult Hit Potential)

**Demographic**: Game industry professionals and enthusiasts.

**Psychographic**: They will play GREENLIGHT as a dark comedy mirror of their own careers. They will recognize the Metacritic religion, the crunch culture subtext, the distance between the boardroom and the development floor. They will screenshot the most painful decisions and post them on Twitter with "this game GETS IT."

**What hooks them**: Authenticity. GREENLIGHT respects the industry without sanitizing it. The 2000s setting is specific and textured. The studio archetypes are real. The board pressure is real. This is not a parody. This is a period piece.

**Messaging**: "The game industry sim that finally understands what it's like to be in the room where the decisions are made." Target GDC, industry influencers, game dev Twitter.

**Platform**: PC/Steam. This audience will buy it on Steam and gift it to their coworkers.

### Crossover Audience (The Sleeper Segment)

**Demographic**: Fans of Reigns, Papers Please, and Lucas Pope's work.

**Psychographic**: People who love decision-making games where the weight of choice is the entire point. They don't need elaborate graphics or action. They want TENSION. They want the mechanical THUNK of the greenlight stamp. They want to see the consequences of their decisions unfold over years. They want games that make them hesitate.

**What hooks them**: "Reigns with 100x the systemic depth." The binary decision-making tension of Reigns applied to the consequence chains of Crusader Kings. Every decision is simple. Every decision is impossible.

**Messaging**: Focus on the stamp. The greenlight table. The moment before the decision. "You watch a pitch. You fund it or kill it. You live with it for years."

**Platform**: PC/Steam primary, but this audience is also on Switch. The "one more turn" loop is perfect for handheld sessions.

## 3. MARKETING TIMELINE (18 Months: Announcement to Launch)

### Phase 1: Stealth Development (Months 1-6, Pre-Announcement)

**Goal**: Build a paper trail. Plant seeds. Create curiosity before the reveal.

**Tactics**:
- **Devlog Series: "Greenlight Diaries"** — Fictional memos from a publisher executive, posted weekly on itch.io or a custom blog. Written in-character as the player character. "Q4 2005 Memo: The Wii launches in 8 weeks and we have zero casual games in development. The board is asking questions I don't have answers to." Build the world. Let the audience roleplay the premise before they can play it.
- **Twitter Account** (@GreenlightGame) — Corporate aesthetic. Tweets styled as internal memos, milestone updates, era event headlines. "INDUSTRY WIRE 2006: Nintendo announces motion-control console. Analysts predict 'gimmick will fail within 18 months.'" Build a following before the game has a trailer.
- **Subreddit Engagement** — Lurk on r/tycoon, r/gamedev, r/Games. Comment on relevant threads. Don't pitch the game. Just exist as a voice in the conversation. When you announce, the community will recognize you.

**Deliverables**:
- 12 Greenlight Diaries posts (1 per week for 3 months)
- Twitter account with 500+ followers before announcement
- Discord server infrastructure (not yet public)

**Budget**: $0 (time only). This is grassroots.

### Phase 4: Content Drip Campaign (Months 11-15, Pre-Launch)

**Goal**: Keep the audience warm. Build anticipation. Turn wishlists into day-one purchases.

**Tactics**:

She makes brilliant games and resents every intervention. Can you earn her trust?" Include portrait, archetype, and a sample pitch. Build attachment before the game launches.
- **GIF Library** — Create 10 GIF-able moments and release them steadily. The greenlight stamp animation. Morale bar draining. Portfolio triangle morphing. Metacritic score reveal. Email notification popping in. Post them on Twitter with captions like "POV: You just cancelled a game and the studio head sends you this email." Let the internet meme them.
- **Reddit AMA** — Month 13. "We're making GREENLIGHT, a game about being a game publisher. AMA about the industry, the simulation, or why we're obsessed with the mid-2000s." Post on r/Games, r/IAmA, r/gamedev.
- **Festival Submissions** — Target Day of the Devs (Month 12), PAX East/West (Month 14), GDC (Month 15 if timing works). GDC is priority — the game industry audience will lose their minds over this premise.

---

### Phase 5: Launch Window (Month 16-18)

**Goal**: Convert wishlists into sales. Create a launch event, not just a release.

**Tactics**:
- **Launch Trailer** (60 seconds, hype-focused):
  - Show the best moments. The stamp. The consequences. The legacy montage. "Available NOW on Steam."

- **Launch Discount** — 10% off for the first week. Wishlists get notified automatically. "You believed in this game before it existed. Here's 10% off."

## 4. STORE PAGE COPY

### Steam Short Description (300 characters max)

You're a game publisher in the 2000s. Studios pitch games. You decide who gets funded. Every greenlight is a bet you'll live with for years. Manage budgets, intervene in development, survive board pressure, and build a legacy across a decade of industry upheaval.

*Character count: 287*

### Steam Long Description

**You don't make games. You decide which games get made.**

GREENLIGHT is a publisher simulation set in the golden chaos of the 2003-2012 game industry. You are the head of publishing at a mid-tier game company. AI-driven studios pitch you games every quarter. You evaluate the pitch, the studio, the market, and your gut — then you stamp GREENLIGHT or PASS.

Every decision ripples for years. The auteur studio you funded in 2004 either delivers a masterpiece in 2007 or implodes under the weight of its own ambition. The sequel you forced into production scores well but burns out the team. The indie game you passed on becomes a competitor's hit. You are powerful and impotent at the same time — you control the money, but you cannot make the game for them.

**MANAGE YOUR PORTFOLIO**

Your performance is measured on three axes: **Prestige** (critical acclaim), **Profit** (revenue), and **Populism** (mainstream appeal). The board sets targets. Miss them and face consequences. You cannot maximize all three. What kind of publisher are you?

**CULTIVATE STUDIO RELATIONSHIPS**

Studios are not interchangeable. Each has a personality, a track record, and a memory. The **Auteur** makes brilliant games but resents intervention. The **Sequel Machine** prints money with franchises but will never innovate unless you push them. The **Indie Spark** needs support but fights corporate mandates. The **Fading Legend** needs reinvention or a graceful ending. Studios talk to each other. Cancel a game cruelly and the industry remembers.

**NAVIGATE A DECADE OF DISRUPTION**

The game simulates real industry forces: Xbox 360 launch, Wii disruption, rise of Metacritic, DLC economy, digital distribution, the 2008 recession. The era is not backdrop — it is a system. The Wii launches whether or not you have a casual game ready. Adapt or drown.

**INTERVENE (OR DON'T)**

At each milestone, you can intervene: Force Multiplayer. Cut the Open World. Ship It Now. Delay to Polish. Fire the Lead Designer. Every intervention has tradeoffs in budget, timeline, and morale. Or choose restraint — trust the studio and let them work. The best publishers know when to act and when to hold.

**BUILD A LEGACY**

After 10 years, the game evaluates your tenure. Which studios did you champion? Which games defined your catalog? What did you sacrifice to get there? The ending is not a score. It is a montage of every decision you made, every studio you believed in or abandoned, and the specific shape of the publisher you built.

**FEATURES**

- **The Greenlight Table** — Evaluate pitches with incomplete information and permanent consequences
- **Studio Relationship Web** — 12-15 persistent AI studios with memory, morale, and grudges
- **Intervention System** — 15+ named actions with visible tradeoffs (budget, timeline, morale, quality)
- **Era Engine** — A decade of industry history as a strategic system
- **Portfolio Matrix** — Balance Prestige, Profit, and Populism to satisfy the board
- **Emergent Stories** — Every playthrough generates unique narratives of success, failure, and compromise

**"If Game Dev Tycoon met Crusader Kings."**
**"If Reigns met Papers Please, but with years of consequences."**
**"If Football Manager met the game industry."**

Wishlist now. Start building your legacy.

## 5. SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT PLAN

### Twitter/X Strategy

**Voice**: Corporate-meets-human. Tweets styled as a mix of internal memos, industry news, and personal reflections. Never break character until launch (then you can be yourself).

**Posting Cadence**: 3-5 tweets per week pre-announcement. Daily during announcement/Next Fest/launch windows.

**Content Pillars**:

1. **Era Nostalgia** (30% of tweets)
   - "INDUSTRY WIRE 2006: PlayStation 3 launches at $599. Analysts predict strong holiday sales. Developers quietly panic about port budgets."
   - "Reminder: In 2005, 'games as a service' meant expansion packs and nobody was happy about always-online DRM."
   - Hooks the 25-40 demographic who lived through this era.

2. **Studio Archetypes** (25% of tweets)
   - "The Auteur studio just sent you a 47-slide pitch deck for a game about grief rendered through architectural metaphor. Do you fund it?"
   - "The Sequel Machine wants to make Warpath V. It will score 78 and sell 2 million copies. It will also bore everyone who works on it. Greenlight?"
   - Introduces the characters. Makes people care before they play.

3. **Decision Dilemmas** (20% of tweets)
   - "A studio is 6 months late and $8M over budget. They're begging for more time. The board wants it cancelled. What's your call?"
   - "You greenlit a game in 2004 that just scored 92 on Metacritic and lost $4 million. The board is furious. The studio is grateful. Was it worth it?"
   - Poses the central tension. Lets the audience roleplay.

4. **GIFs and Visuals** (15% of tweets)
   - Post the stamp animation with caption: "POV: You're about to make a decision you'll be living with for 3 years."
   - Post a morale bar draining with caption: "When you force multiplayer into a single-player narrative game."
   - Let the internet meme your game.

5. **Community Engagement** (10% of tweets)
   - Retweet fan art, Discord screenshots, Reddit threads.
   - Reply to questions. Be helpful, not salesy.
   - Run polls: "Which era event terrifies you most? A) Wii launch B) Recession C) Metacritic influence D) Mobile gaming rise"

**Hashtag Strategy**:
- Use sparingly. #indiegame, #gamedev, #simulation, #Steam only when relevant.
- Create a branded hashtag: #GreenlightGame (use in community contests, fan sharing)

**Pin Strategy**:
- Pre-announcement: Pin the best Greenlight Diaries post.
- Post-announcement: Pin the reveal trailer.
- Pre-launch: Pin the Steam page link with current wishlist count.
- Post-launch: Pin the launch trailer.

### Reddit Strategy

**Primary Subreddits**:
- r/Games (465K members) — Announcement post, launch post, major updates only. Follow self-promotion rules (10:1 ratio).
- r/indiegaming (305K) — More permissive. Post devlogs, behind-the-scenes, GIFs.
- r/tycoon (85K) — Core audience. They WILL engage.
- r/gamedev (1.2M) — Post about design challenges, systems, AI studio behavior. Frame as educational, not promotional.
- r/SimulationGaming (48K) — Niche but passionate.

**Posting Strategy**:
- Never lead with "buy my game." Lead with value: a story, a design problem, a GIF.
- Example good post: "We're simulating a decade of game industry history as a strategic system. Here's how the 2006 Wii launch works in GREENLIGHT." (Include dev blog link, GIF of casual game demand spiking.)
- Example bad post: "Check out our new game GREENLIGHT! Wishlist on Steam!"

**Community Engagement**:
- Reply to every comment in the first 2 hours.
- Be helpful. If someone asks "how did you design the AI studios?" answer thoroughly.
- If someone criticizes the premise, engage respectfully. Never argue. "That's a fair concern. Here's how we're addressing it."

**AMA Strategy**:
- Post on r/Games or r/IAmA (r/Games requires mod approval, apply 2 weeks early).
- Title: "We're making GREENLIGHT, a game about being a game publisher in the 2000s. AMA about the simulation, the industry, or why Metacritic haunts us."
- Prepare 20 canned answers for common questions (How does the Era Engine work? What's the core loop? Why this time period?).
- Stay live for 3 hours minimum. Answer everything.

---

### Discord Strategy

**Server Structure**:

Channels:
- **#announcements** (read-only) — Dev updates, patch notes, trailer drops.
- **#general** — Open chat.
- **#game-discussion** — Strategy talk, system breakdowns, meta optimization.
- **#studio-stories** — Players share emergent narratives. "I just turned a Fading studio into an industry leader and it took 6 years."
- **#feedback** — Bug reports, feature requests.
- **#fan-art** — Screenshots, memes, fan creations.
- **#off-topic** — Non-game chat (keeps #general focused).

Roles:
- **Developer** (you and team)
- **Early Supporter** (anyone who wishlisted before announcement)
- **Playtester** (if you run closed beta)
- **Community Contributor** (active members, helpful people)

**Moderation**:
- Hire or recruit 2 volunteer mods by Month 10 (Steam Next Fest). Community will grow fast.
- Rules: No harassment, no spam, no piracy links, no spoilers outside #spoiler channel.

**Engagement**:
- Post weekly discussion prompts: "What's the worst greenlight decision you've ever made?"
- Host monthly events: Screenshot contests, challenge runs ("Win without cancelling a single project"), speedruns.
- Developer presence: Pop in 2-3 times per week. Answer questions. Share design insights.

---

### TikTok Strategy (Yes, Really)

**Why TikTok**: The greenlight stamp animation is perfect for short-form video. The decision dilemmas are perfect for text-on-screen storytelling. The nostalgia for 2000s gaming hits the 20-30 demographic.

**Content Ideas**:
- 15-second video: Studio pitches a game (text on screen), player hovers over stamp, cut to consequence (morale bar draining or Metacritic score). Caption: "I should not have forced multiplayer."
- "POV: You're a game publisher" series. Text-on-screen scenarios with consequence reveals.
- Behind-the-scenes: "How we designed the greenlight stamp" (show animation process, satisfying sound design).
- Nostalgia bait: "The 2006 Wii launch, but you're the publisher scrambling to respond."

**Posting Cadence**: 2-3 videos per week starting Month 9 (post-announcement).

**Goal**: Not sales. Brand awareness. If 1 video hits 100K views, that's 100K people who now know GREENLIGHT exists. Some percentage will find the Steam page.

### Pitch Email Template (Personalized per Outlet)

**Subject**: [Outlet Name] — GREENLIGHT announcement: The game industry sim from the publisher's perspective

**Body**:

Hi [Name],

I'm [Your Name], [Your Role] on GREENLIGHT, a publisher simulation we're announcing [Date].

**The premise**: You're a game publisher executive in the 2000s. Studios pitch you games. You decide who gets funded. Every greenlight is a bet you'll live with for years. It's Game Dev Tycoon meets Crusader Kings — systemic management sim with human consequences.

**Why I'm reaching out**: [Personalized sentence. Examples:]
- "I read your feature on management sims and thought you'd appreciate GREENLIGHT's studio relationship system — studios remember your decisions and respond like people, not stat sheets."
- "Your review of Reigns mentioned the weight of binary decisions. GREENLIGHT is built on that same tension, but the consequences ripple across a 10-year campaign."
- "You covered the rise of Metacritic's influence in [article]. GREENLIGHT simulates that era as a strategic system — including the moment Metacritic scores started determining developer bonuses."

**The hook**: There are games about making games. There has never been a game about funding games. You are the gatekeeper. The person who says yes or no to someone else's creative vision. The distance between your power and your control is where the emotional core lives.

**Press kit**: [Link to Dropbox / Google Drive]
**Embargo**: [Date and time, if applicable]
**Review build availability**: [Date, if applicable]

I'd love to chat if this sounds up your alley. No pressure if it's not your beat.

Thanks for your time,
[Your Name]
[Contact Info]

## 7. COMMUNITY BUILDING STRATEGY

### Discord Server (The Hub)

**Launch Timing**: Month 7 (announcement day).

**Goal**: Create a space where players become fans before the game launches. Fans become evangelists.

**Tactics**:
- **Weekly Discussion Prompts**: "If you were a publisher in 2006 and the Wii just launched, what's your strategy?"
- **Developer AMA Sessions**: Monthly, 1 hour, live Q&A in #general.
- **Community Contests**:
  - Month 10: "Pitch Your Dream Game" (winner's pitch becomes an Easter egg)
  - Month 14: "Worst Greenlight Decision" screenshot contest (winner gets free copy + Steam gift card)
  - Month 18: "Publisher Legacy" speedrun (fastest S-rank completion)
- **Exclusive Content**: Share early screenshots, WIP animations, design documents with Discord members first.

**Moderation**: Recruit 2 volunteer mods from the community by Month 10. Look for helpful, active members.

---

### Subreddit (r/GreenlightGame)

**Launch Timing**: Month 9 (post-Next Fest, when there's enough content to sustain it).

**Goal**: Long-form strategy discussion, emergent story sharing, modding community (if supported).

**Tactics**:
- Seed the subreddit with 10 discussion threads (cross-post from Discord).
- Weekly "Studio Spotlight" posts (deep dive into one studio archetype).
- Monthly "Playthrough Diaries" where players document a full campaign.
- Promote on main subreddits (r/tycoon, r/Games) with "Join us at r/GreenlightGame."

---

### Steam Community Hub

**Goal**: Surface user-generated content, build social proof.

**Tactics**:
- **Guides**: Encourage players to write strategy guides ("How to Earn an Auteur's Trust," "Surviving the 2008 Recession," "Optimal Portfolio Balance").
- **Screenshots**: Highlight the best screenshots in announcements. Retweet them.
- **Discussions**: Monitor and respond to threads. If someone asks a question, answer it within 24 hours.
- **Workshop** (if modding supported): Feature the best mods in Steam announcements.

---

## 8. PAID MARKETING BUDGET (Launch Window)

**Total Budget**: $14K (launch window only, Month 16-18)

### Allocation

**Steam Featured Placement** ($8K):
- Negotiate with Valve for front-page featuring during launch week (if possible).
- Alternatively: Buy placements in "New & Trending," "Top Sellers," or "Simulation" category homepage.
- ROI: Hard to measure, but front-page visibility can drive 5-10K wishlists alone.

**YouTube Pre-Roll Ads** ($3K):
- Target: Users who watch Game Dev Tycoon, Crusader Kings, management sim content.
- 15-second ad: The greenlight stamp animation + "You decide which games get made. Wishlist GREENLIGHT on Steam."
- Run for 2 weeks around launch.
- Goal: 500K impressions, 2% CTR (10K clicks to Steam page).

**Reddit Promoted Posts** ($2K):
- Target: r/Games, r/tycoon, r/indiegaming.
- Promote the launch trailer post.
- Run for 1 week during launch.
- Goal: 100K impressions, 1% CTR (1K clicks to Steam page).

**Twitter Promoted Tweets** ($1K):
- Promote the launch trailer tweet.
- Target: Followers of @GameDevTycoon, @ParadoxInteractive, @lucaspopedev (Papers Please).
- Run for 1 week during launch.
- Goal: 50K impressions, 2% engagement (1K likes/RTs/clicks).

### Why This Budget?

**Reasoning**: Most of the marketing is organic (press, influencers, community). Paid ads are a multiplier, not the foundation. $14K is enough to boost visibility during the critical launch window without overspending on unproven channels.

**Alternative if Budget is Lower**: Cut paid ads entirely. Focus everything on press, influencers, and community. GREENLIGHT's hook is strong enough to spread organically if the content is good.

## 9. TRAILER SCRIPT (90-Second Reveal Trailer)

**VISUAL** | **AUDIO** | **TEXT ON SCREEN**

---

**[0:00-0:05]**
Black screen. Sound of a projector warming up (gentle hum, slight buzz).
| Projector hum, office ambience (distant keyboard clicks) |
"2005."

---

**[0:05-0:15]**
Interior: Conference room. Mahogany table. A pitch document lands on the table (paper sound). Camera slowly pushes in.
| Paper rustling. Footsteps. A studio representative sits down across from us (implied POV: we are the executive). |
"A studio is pitching you a game."

---

**[0:15-0:25]**
Close-up: Pitch dossier fills the screen (Cathedral Studios, game title: *Lithograph*, genre: narrative action, budget: $35M). Studio head portrait visible (Tomoko Sato, serious expression, making eye contact).
| Soft piano note. Studio head speaks (no actual dialogue, just implied presence). |
"Do you believe?"

---

**[0:25-0:30]**
Hand (player's hand, implied) hovers over the greenlight stamp. Finger hesitates above the button. The stamp glows (green ring).
| Tense silence. Heartbeat-like low percussion. |
[No text. Let the tension sit.]

---

**[0:30-0:35]**
THUNK. The stamp comes down. "APPROVED" mark appears on the document in green ink.
| Mechanical stamp sound (satisfying, weighty). |
"You greenlight."

---

**[0:35-0:50]**
Time-lapse montage: Milestone review screens flash by. Budget bars shift. Morale bar drains from green to yellow to red. A studio email appears ("We need more time."). Board evaluation screen: Portfolio triangle morphs, one axis drops below target (red warning). Era event notification: "THE WII LAUNCHES. Casual market demand: UP."
| Music builds: Corporate ambience layered under subtle orchestral tension. Percussion ticks like a clock. |
"You manage."

---

**[0:50-0:55]**
Intervention screen: Player chooses "Force Multiplayer." Morale bar plummets. Studio portrait shifts to frustrated expression.
| Discordant piano note (minor key). |
"You intervene."

---

**[0:55-1:00]**
Metacritic score reveal: 92. Green. Success. Revenue tally: -$4M (red, loss). Studio email: "Thank you for believing in us."
| Music swells (major key resolution, but bittersweet). |
"You live with it."

---

**[1:00-1:10]**
Board evaluation: Triangle reshapes. Board member portraits appear with speech bubbles ("Prestige is exceptional." "Profit is concerning."). Camera pulls back from the conference table. The room is empty now. Just the documents, the portfolio chart, the legacy.
| Music softens. Ambient office sounds fade. |
"Every greenlight is a bet."

---

**[1:10-1:20]**
Legacy montage (rapid cuts): Game titles. Metacritic scores. Studio portraits (some celebrating, some frustrated). Timeline spine with nodes. Final shot: The greenlight stamp, inactive, sitting on the desk. Camera pushes in on the stamp.
| Piano solo, gentle and reflective. |
"Every bet has a legacy."

---

**[1:20-1:30]**
Fade to black. Logo appears: "GREENLIGHT" (condensed sans-serif, white text). Stamp icon glows beneath it.
| Final piano chord holds. Silence. |
"GREENLIGHT"
"You don't make games. You decide which games get made."
"Wishlist now on Steam."
[Steam logo, platform logos]

---

**[1:30]**
End card: Steam page URL, social media handles, release window ("Coming 2027").
| Fade out. |

---

### Trailer Notes

**Pacing**: Slow build (0-30s), escalating tension (30-60s), emotional climax (60-90s). Never rush. Let moments breathe.

**Music**: Custom score or licensed cinematic track. Needs to feel like a prestige drama (Severance, Margin Call) not a game trailer. Avoid EDM, rock, epic orchestral bombast. This is corporate ambience meets human emotion.

**Voiceover**: NONE. Let the visuals and text carry it. A voiceover would break the "you are the executive" POV.

**Text on Screen**: Minimal. Short sentences. Let each line land before the next appears. Never more than 8 words at once.

---

## 10. METRICS AND SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

**Pre-Launch**:
- **Wishlist Count**: 100K wishlists by Month 15 (2 months before launch). Stretch: 150K.
- **Demo Downloads**: 50K downloads during Steam Next Fest (Month 10).
- **Press Coverage**: 10+ articles from Tier 1 outlets (PC Gamer, RPS, IGN, Polygon, etc.).
- **Influencer Coverage**: 20+ videos from mid-tier influencers (10K+ views each).
- **Community Size**: 1K Discord members, 500 subreddit subscribers by launch.

**Launch Window (First 4 Weeks)**:
- **Sales**: 15K copies in Week 1 (15% wishlist conversion). 30K copies in Month 1.
- **Revenue**: $300K gross revenue in Month 1 (at $20 price point, 30% Steam cut = $210K net).
- **Review Score**: 80+ on OpenCritic / Metacritic (aggregate of reviews).
- **User Reviews**: 500+ Steam reviews, 85%+ positive rating ("Very Positive").
- **Influencer Coverage**: 50+ videos/streams in launch month.

**Long-Tail (First Year)**:
- **Sales**: 100K copies in Year 1 (realistic for a well-reviewed indie management sim).
- **Revenue**: $1.4M gross, $980K net.
- **Community Growth**: 5K Discord members, 2K subreddit subscribers.
- **Content**: 2 major updates or DLC releases (if performance justifies).

### Success Benchmarks (Comparable Games)

**Game Dev Tycoon** (2013):
- 2.5M copies sold lifetime (as of 2021).
- Early success driven by viral "piracy punishment" mechanic (free press).
- Lesson: A single viral moment can transform trajectory. GREENLIGHT's viral moment could be "the stamp" or a particularly brutal decision.

**Papers, Please** (2013):
- 1M copies sold in first year.
- Driven by word-of-mouth, unique premise, satisfying mechanics.
- Lesson: A strong hook + tight execution = sustainable sales.

**Reigns** (2016):
- 1M+ downloads on mobile, 200K+ on Steam.
- Driven by innovative UI, decision-making tension.
- Lesson: Binary decisions with long-term consequences are inherently replayable.

**Two Point Hospital** (2018):
- 1M copies sold in first year.
- Driven by nostalgia (Theme Hospital successor), humor, depth.
- Lesson: Nostalgia is a powerful hook if executed with care.

### What Success Looks Like

**Minimum Viable Success** (Pays for development, justifies existence):
- 30K copies sold in Year 1.
- $420K net revenue (assuming $600K dev budget, this breaks even).
- 80+ review score.
- Active community (Discord, subreddit).

**Strong Success** (Justifies post-launch support, expansions):
- 100K copies sold in Year 1.
- $1.4M gross, $980K net.
- 85+ review score.
- 10+ "Best of Year" mentions in indie game lists.

**Breakout Success** (Franchise potential, ports, sequels):
- 500K+ copies sold in Year 1.
- $7M gross, $4.9M net.
- 90+ review score.
- Cult following. Players making mods, sharing stories, demanding sequels.

## 11. RISKS AND MITIGATION

### Risk 1: The Hook Doesn't Land

**The Risk**: Players don't find the "publisher fantasy" compelling. They want to make games, not fund them.

**Mitigation**:
- Test the hook early (Steam Next Fest demo). If demo downloads are low (<20K), the hook isn't working.
- Refine messaging. Emphasize the power fantasy ("You control the industry") AND the emotional weight ("You decide whose dream lives").
- Comp to successful games: "If you loved Game Dev Tycoon, this is the other side of that story."

### Risk 2: Information Overload

**The Risk**: The greenlight table is too dense. Players feel overwhelmed, not engaged.

**Mitigation**:
- UI clarity is sacred. Playtest relentlessly (see art direction doc, readability checklist).
- Tutorial must be invisible. No walls of text. Show, don't tell.
- Progressive disclosure: Start simple (Year 1 has 3 studios, limited options). Ramp complexity slowly.

### Risk 3: Market Saturation

**The Risk**: Management sim fatigue. The market is crowded.

**Mitigation**:
- Differentiate on premise. GREENLIGHT is not "another tycoon game." It's the publisher sim. That niche is empty.
- Differentiate on emotion. Most management sims are optimization puzzles. GREENLIGHT makes you feel the weight of decisions.
- The 2000s setting is unique. No other management sim is doing this era at this level of specificity.

### Risk 4: Press Ignores It

**The Risk**: Outlets don't cover the announcement. Trailer lands flat.

**Mitigation**:
- Personalize every pitch email. Show you've read their work.
- Time the announcement well. Avoid major industry events (E3, TGA, big AAA releases). Pick a quiet news week.
- Have a backup plan: If press coverage is weak, double down on influencers and community.

### Risk 5: Launch Week Bugs

**The Risk**: Game launches with critical bugs. Reviews suffer. Refund rate spikes.

**Mitigation**:
- Closed beta (Month 15). Recruit 100 playtesters from Discord. Pay them in free copies + credits.
- Day-one patch ready. Assume bugs will surface. Have a fix pipeline ready.
- Communication: If bugs hit, post immediately on Steam, Discord, Twitter. "We're aware of [bug]. Fix incoming in [timeframe]." Transparency builds trust.

### Risk 6: Wishlist-to-Sales Conversion is Low

**The Risk**: 100K wishlists only convert to 5K sales (5% instead of 15%).

**Mitigation**:
- Remind wishlists: Email blast (via Steam) 1 week before launch. "You wishlisted GREENLIGHT. It launches [date]. Here's 10% off."
- Launch discount: 10% off for first week. Lowers barrier.
- Launch event: Make launch day feel like an event (Discord party, influencer coverage, Reddit AMA). FOMO drives sales.

---

## 12. POST-LAUNCH MARKETING (Year 1+)

### Content Update Announcements

**If the game performs well**, announce a roadmap:
- **Update 1 (Month 20)**: Franchise System (stretch goal). "Successful games can now spawn sequels. Manage a franchise across installments."
- **Update 2 (Month 24)**: Executive Skill Tree. "Unlock passive abilities as you gain experience. Better gut-feel accuracy, cheaper interventions, studio morale buffs."
- **Update 3 (Month 28)**: Rival Publishers. "Compete with 2-3 AI publishers for studios, exclusivity deals, and market dominance."

**Why**: Keeps the community engaged. Signals ongoing support. Drives second-wave sales ("Game is still getting updates? Worth buying.").

**Marketing**: Each update gets a Steam announcement, a trailer (30s, showing new features), press outreach ("GREENLIGHT just added franchise management"), and community event (Discord contest around new features).

---

### Sale Events

**Timing**:
- **Month 22 (Summer Sale)**: 20% off. Target: New players who wishlisted but didn't buy at launch.
- **Month 24 (Winter Sale)**: 30% off. Target: Holiday gift buyers, "what should I play over break?" crowd.
- **Month 30 (Year-End Sale)**: 40% off. Target: Deep backlog buyers.

**Marketing**: Each sale gets a new piece of key art or a GIF. Post on Twitter, Reddit, Steam. "GREENLIGHT is 20% off during Steam Summer Sale. Build a publisher legacy for $16."

---

### Platform Expansion

**If PC sales justify it** (100K+ copies sold):
- **Month 24**: Announce Switch port. "GREENLIGHT is coming to Nintendo Switch in [quarter]."
- **Month 28**: Launch Switch version. Full marketing cycle (trailer, press, influencers).
- **Potential**: Mobile tablet port (Month 36+). Lower priority unless Switch performs well.

**Why**: New platforms = new audiences. Switch players love management sims (see: Stardew Valley, Two Point Hospital). The "one more turn" loop is perfect for handheld.

---

## 13. FINAL THOUGHTS (HYPE's Sign-Off)

Listen.

The best game in the world sells zero copies if nobody knows it exists. GREENLIGHT has a hook that stops scrolls. It has a premise that makes people say "oh, that's cool." It has depth that will keep them playing until 3 AM. But none of that matters if we don't build the audience NOW.

Start on day one. Not day last.

The Greenlight Diaries posts start 6 months before announcement. The Twitter account launches 6 months before announcement. The community starts forming before the game has screenshots. By the time we announce, there's already a crowd waiting.

Marketing is not a phase. Marketing is a practice that runs parallel to development from the first commit.

What's the hook in 5 seconds? You watch a pitch. You fund it or kill it. You live with it for years.

What's the GIF? The greenlight stamp coming down. The studio's reaction. The morale bar shifting. Five seconds. One decision. Infinite consequences.

Show the GAME, not the features. Nobody cares about "15+ intervention options" until they see a morale bar drain because they forced multiplayer into a single-player narrative game. Show the moment. Show the weight.

This game will find its audience. Our job is to make sure the audience can find the game.

Start building NOW.
